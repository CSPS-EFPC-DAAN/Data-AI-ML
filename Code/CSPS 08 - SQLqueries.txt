1. Sample SQL query that can be used to create a database view in SQLite, that can then be exported

select FirstName, LastName, State, Country, g.Name, t.Name, InvoiceDate, m.UnitPrice, Milliseconds
from customers c
inner join invoices i
on c.Customerid = i.Customerid
inner join invoice_items m
on i.Invoiceid = m.Invoiceid
inner join tracks t
on m.Trackid = t.Trackid
inner join genres g
on t.Genreid = g.Genreid

2. Sample SQL query that can be used to export a view (here named MyNewView) from SQLite

select * from MyNewView
