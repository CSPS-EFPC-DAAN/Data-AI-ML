1,1 Regular,10/12/2016,7:00 PM,,Toronto Maple Leafs,5,4,W,OT,1,0,0,W 1,30,13,0,2,0,38,11,0,4,0,"17,618",2:36,Maple Leafs' Matthews has modern record 4 goals in NHL debut,"Auston Matthews needed 40 minutes to get into the NHL record book. In the highest-scoring debut in modern NHL history, Matthews scored four goals for the Toronto Maple Leafs, but Kyle Turris scored 37 seconds into overtime to give the Ottawa Senators to a 5-4 victory Wednesday night. Matthews got his fourth with 3 seconds left in the second period, bringing his mother to tears in the stands. He called it a ""surreal"" moment, adding that ""I couldn't believe that was happening out there."" The 19-year-old from Scottsdale, Arizona, is the 12th first overall pick to score in his NHL debut. ""Since I've been the Leafs coach, that's the best night I've had since I've been here by 10 miles,"" said second-year coach Mike Babcock. ""Not even close."" Despite the historic first game, Matthews took responsibility for the loss after failing to pick up Turris coming into the Toronto zone. Turris took in a pass from Mark Stone with Matthews chasing, set himself and fired a shot by Frederik Andersen. ""That last play was 100 percent my fault,"" Matthews said. ""We came here to win and we didn't get that done."" Turris scored twice, including the tying goal 6:45 into the third period. Bobby Ryan, Erik Karlsson and Derick Brassard also scored for Ottawa. Frederik Andersen stopped 25 shots for the Maple Leafs. Craig Anderson had 34 saves for Ottawa. Matthews scored on his first shot 8:21 into the first period, snapping in a pass from Zach Hyman during a scrum around the net. The second goal came with 5:42 left in the first period. He dangled through a pair of Senators near the blue line, stole the puck from two-time Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson along the boards then beat Anderson with an odd-angle forehand. ""I've never seen anything like it,"" Babcock said. ""He's a good player. You see that second goal he scored, not many guys do that."" Matthews put Toronto ahead 3-2 with a one-timer from inside the right circle on a feed from Morgan Rielly 1:25 into the second period, and fans showered the ice with hats. The fourth goal followed a give-and-go with William Nylander. Matthews lifted the puck past Anderson after blowing by a defender in the slot. Nylander had two assists. Matthews scored on his first three shots of the game. ""He's a man,"" Babcock said. ""He's 19 years old but he acts like he's 27. He has great maturity. If you meet his mom and dad, you're thoroughly impressed with the kind of people they are and the respect he has for his mom and sisters, the kind of guy he is. ""Don't get me wrong, we would've drafted him anyway, but that makes him more special."" His parents, Brian and Ema, were in the stands and celebrated the first goal with a kiss. After the third goal, Matthews' mom was shown on the broadcast high-fiving fans and covering her face in disbelief. She cried following the third and fourth goals. ""Those were tears of joy,"" Ema Matthews said. ""I feel very excited. This is what Auston has been dreaming since he was 6, be playing right here in the NHL."" ""I hope that nobody's going to wake me up here anytime soon,"" Brian Matthews said. ""This is unbelievable."" Matthews' success was no surprise to Senators coach Guy Boucher, who coached against the young center last season in the Swiss Elite League. ""He's the real deal,"" Boucher said. ""I told everybody and I saw it firsthand last year so I'm not surprised. He's the total package. He played against men last year and he's playing against men now, so I'm not surprised."" Matthews' debut captivated the league on the season's opening night. ""Feels like I'm watching mite hockey where there's that one kid who's just way better than everyone else. Congrats,"" tweeted retired forward Martin St. Louis. ""Most guys would be thrilled to score four in a month.... #easygame"" wrote Hurricanes forward Viktor Stalberg. Matthews was the fifth player with three goals in his NHL debut since 1943-44 and first since Derek Stepan with the New York Rangers in October 2010. Alex Smart (Montreal, 1943), Real Cloutier (Quebec, 1979) and Fabian Brunnstrom (Dallas, 2008) also had hat tricks in their first NHL games, though Cloutier played five seasons with the Nordiques in the WHA before that. NOTES: D Thomas Chabot and LW Matt Puempel were a healthy scratch for the Senators. Toronto D Frank Corrado and Roman Polak as well as C Seth Griffith were a healthy scratch. UP NEXT Maple Leafs: Host Boston on Saturday night for their home opener. Senators: Host Montreal on Saturday night.  ",Ross A,Auston Matthews Loses 5-4 to Sens in OT,"The NHL.com headline for the game was _Auston Matthews scores four goals, Maple LeafsloseÓ, and really that sums up the entire game. It was a whirlwind of emotion for the new hotness, setting an NHL debut record but ultimately losing. In the end, as a Senators fan, Iêm happy that they didnêt win, so maybe the Sens can live this down a little bit in future games against the Leafs. The game started exactly the way I expected: a shift counter for Mitch Marnerês first NHL shift. Then the same thing for Auston Matthews. If youêd happened to forget the Maple Leafs are the CBCês favourite team by a nautical mile, you remembered in a hurry. Thankfully, the commentators also threw us a bone by referring to noted winger _John van RiemsdykÓ. And it wasnêt even Bob Cole! The Sens looked sloppy early, and the Leafs looked threatening. Marner almost made every Sens fanês worst nightmare come true when he got a breakaway early, but thankfully he missed. Unthankfully (disthankfully?) Matthews put home a shot from the slot after a crease scramble to make everyone in hockey happy. The Sens would get a little reprieve with Erik Karlssonsetting up a pair goals - Bobby Ryan tucked home a Karlsson rebound in the crease, and then a Leafs defender tipped a Karlsson shot top-corner. Matthews would then restore order to hockeydom by going through half the Sens team to score a beautiful goal for the second of his career (and the period). As nice as his moves were, I have to give some of the goal credit to Craig Anderson for not ever getting square to Matthews, despite the fact that he was the only player in the zone. The teams would then trade unsuccessful powerplays to end the period, which finished 2-2. The first period also featured an early hit by Chris Neil on Matt Hunwick. Hunwickês head hit the glass first, he was bleeding, and he did not return to the game. It was never officially called a concussion, but was likely the first use of the NHLês new concussion spotter protocol.  The first intermission featured a nice video plea by Austonês father Brian (Matthews) to the city of Toronto to love his son as much as he (Auston) loves them. It seemed a little hokey to me, even for a 1st-overall pick, but I guess this is the first thing Torontoês had to be excited about in a long time. The second period opened exactly the way you knew it would: with Matthews scoring a goal, to be the fifth player ever to score a hat-trick in his NHL debut. And essentially that would do it for the second. The Sens would spend half the period on the PK, but nothing happened on the scoresheet until they were down to just two minutes in the period. Late in the period, Derick Brassard skated the length of the ice holding off Martin Marincin before stuffing the puck five-hole on Andersen. It was a goal both of those Leafs would want back. But before they could think about it much, Mike Hoffman came roaring in and backhanded it off the crossbar.  And just when you thought you were safe, Matthews got a 2-on-1 with William Nylander with 10 seconds to go and made no mistake on Nylanderês dish. He became the first player to score four goals in his NHL debut ever. The period ended with the score Matthews 4, Sens 3. The third period went a little better for the Sens, in that they managed to tie up the score. Kyle Turris went in hard on Marincin on the forecheck, forcing him into just sending it around the boards. Mark Stone intercepted, and hit Turris in front where he beat Andersen over his left shoulder. The Leafs wanted icing on the play, but the puck was too slow and the refs ruled Marincin shouldêve been able to play it before the red line. That would do it for scoring in regulation, so the game went to overtime. OT was a lot of fun as a Sens fan, as Turris-Stone-Karlsson held possession for the entire time. They opened the period, played keep-away, and then eventually Turris got the shot he wanted, right in the middle of the slot. He buried his second of the night, and the Sens got a hard-fought win. Sens Hero: Kyle Turris Scoring two goals will get you hero status, especially when they were the final two goals of an overtime win. Sens Hero: Mark Stone Stoneês speed and hands were on display to full effect in this game, leading directly to the game-tying goal in the third period. Honourable Mention: Erik Karlsson He _onlyÓ put up three points in this game. He also finished with eight shots on goal. In a game in which the Sens were pretty badly outshot (38-30), Karlsson at least finished with the majority of shots on goal while he was on the ice. It might be petty, but I have a hard time giving him a full hero nod after he got walked by Matthews for a goal. Still, if King Karl can put up three points in a game, the Sens will have a good chance of winning those games. Dishonourable Mention: Craig Anderson He just seemed a little... off. From not squaring up to Matthewsê second goal, to giving up lots of rebounds, to losing track of far too many pucks, he seemed a little rusty. Hopefully that was a just a first-game-jitters thing, or this could be a very tough season. Sens Killer: Auston Matthews Did you know he scored four goals? Did you know it was his first NHL game? Did you know thatês never been done before? Just thought you should know.  ",Pension Plan Puppet,"Sens 5, Auston Matthews 4 (OT)","The first period started exactly the way that Leafs' fans wanted it to. Each line looked strong, and each of the kids looked fantastic. Just under eight minutes into the game, Mitchell Marner raced off on a breakaway, and although he was hounded all the way, he got a great chance, only to be stopped by Craig Anderson. But then, 12 minutes in to the first period, it was William Nylander making a great move to get the puck deep into the Sens' zone and create a great chance for the Leafs. Then, Zach Hyman, doing some great work down low, flipped a pass out front to none other than Auston Matthews, who scored on his third shift of his NHL career to open the scoring, and a new era, for the Leafs. Marner almost made it 2-0 halfway through the period when he deftly took a pass on his off wing and still managed to stay onside, ripping a shot off the crossbar behind Andersen. Marner had a tough angle and little time to get the shot away, and clearly surprised Anderson. Bobby Ryan tied the game minutes later when he parked himself in front of the Leafs' net and out-muscled Jake Gardiner for the rebound. The Sens picked up the go-ahead goal just over two minutes later as Erik Karlsson took a slapper from the point that deflected off a Leaf stick, bounced off the ice, and fooled Andersen. Tough break. Then, things got really fun. Matthews did this: Oh my. I'll pause here and let you just absorb that for a minute. ... ... ... And we're back. The Leafs looked strong through the rest of the period, killing a penalty, but also getting the majority of shot attempts. The shots on goal were 13-9 for the Sens after 20 minutes, but it was the Leafs who looked like the better team. Before the second period got underway, we learned that Matt Hunwick would not return to the game. Less than a minute and thirty seconds into the second period, Matthews made it a hat trick. That's right, Matthews scored a hat trick in his first game. The Leafs proceeded to dominate most of the period, forcing the Sens to take multiple penalties (including one from former Leafs' Captain Dion Phaneuf). The Sens did manage to tie it up though, on a great effort by new Sen Derrick Brassard and a poor save selection by Andersen: BUT WAIT. WITH THREE SECONDS LEFT IN THE SECOND PERIOD, THIS HAPPENED: THAT'S RIGHT. MATTHEWS BECAME THE FIRST PLAYER IN NHL HISTORY TO SCORE FOUR GOALS IN A DEBUT GAME. FOUR GOALS. WHAT. IS. THIS. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OK, I'm going to try to calm down, but I probably won't be successful. The third period got off to a rocky start. Nylander took a penalty and the Sens had several decent looks at the net. Then, Martin Marincin let off the gas just a little too soon on a play that would otherwise have been called icing, and with a quick pass, Mark Stone found Kyle Turrissitting all alone in front - Marincin couldn't get there in time. The Leafs and Sens traded chances through the third period, but the Leafs got the better of the two teams, out-shooting Ottawa 10-8 in the final frame and 38-29 through regulation. This one needed OT. The Leafs sent Morgan Rielly out with Matthews and Nylander to start overtime, but the Sens ruined the whole darn party when Turris scored his second of the game to win it. The ugly truth is that Matthews should have had Turris on that play, but it's pretty hard to criticize the guy after this game. A few thoughts on individual players (but I'm still on too much of a Matthews-high to be very specific): - Auston Matthews, enough said. - Mitch Marner was unbelievable tonight. Matthews wound up with the hat trick, but it could almost just as easily been Marner who stole the show. He was fantastic all over the ice. - William Nylander looked great tonight, and Matthews' wing is the perfect place for him. I can't wait to watch more of him. - Nikita Zaitsev looked great all game. He skated the puck deep into the offensive zone on multiple occasions and looked good doing it. In his own end, his quick stick was put to good use, and I can't recall once seeing him out of position. He looked like a solid NHL player tonight. - Connor Brown took a questionable penalty in the first period but apart from that was just nails all night. He plays like a man who is much bigger. - Peter Holland also had a great night. I can't remember the last time the Leafs' fourth line wasn't terrible. - Matt Martin fought a guy and took a dumb penalty. When he was on the ice, he didn't look bad, though. - Frederik Andersen will probably want to forget tonight. Five goals against is a tough night by any goalie's standards, but the stinker he let in on the Brassard goal will be the lowlight for him. He made some great saves tonight as well, but he'll need to be better in the future. - The Kadri line looked good all night, even though they didn't find the scoresheet. They give the Leafs three effective forward lines to work with and that's tough on any defence corps. - Zach Hyman seems like a great fit for Matthews' left wing. Let's keep him there a while.  "

The Senators' head coach opted to go with defenseman Erik Karlsson and the captain scored the game winner to give Ottawa a 4-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night to open the season with back-to-back wins. ""Sometimes it's just small things and you follow a gut feeling,"" Boucher said. ""Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you look like a genius and sometimes you look like an idiot, this time I look like a genius. "" Despite some struggles through its first two games Ottawa is finding ways to win. The Senators had a great start on Saturday, struggled midway, but came back strong and feel they can build off the effort. ""I think it was a well-played game by both teams,"" Karlsson said. ""We did what we had to do even though they scored two in the third. It didn't set us back. We kept going and stuck to our game plan and we didn't let ourselves stray away from what we felt we had to do to have a chance to win this game. "" Tom Pyatt, Ryan Dzingel and Zack Smith scored for the Senators (2-0-0) in regulation and Craig Anderson had 21 saves. Jeff Petry scored twice and Artturi Lehkonen got his first NHL goal for the Canadiens. Al Montoya stopped 35 shots. Canadiens coach Michel Therrien was pleased with the overall effort, but falling behind early made things difficult. ""Our execution wasn't there at the start of the game,"" said Therrien. ""We made some adjustments in the second and it seemed to pay off. "" Pyatt tied the score 3-3 off a great pass from Dzingel to beat Montoya stick side with 2:33 remaining in the third period. Dzingel was impressive all night and was rewarded for his efforts, getting ice time in the overtime session. ""I think I'm getting a little bit more confident and coach is playing me in bigger situations so just trying to grow my confidence and keep playing the way I do,"" Dzingel said. ""I'm bringing pace and speed and that's all I'm worrying about. "" Dzingel and Smith scored in the first period to put the Senators up 2-0 as they outshot the Canadiens 13-6 and had some solid work on the penalty kill. Dzingel opened the scoring at the 6-minute mark with a great personal effort as he picked up his own rebound and beat Montoya short side. Dennis Wideman's point shot deflected in off smith 's skate with 4:10 left in the period. Petry's power-play goal with about 4 1/2 minutes left in the second got the Canadiens on the scoreboard. Lehkonen tied it at 2:50 of the third, grabbing a loose puck and sliding it through anderson 's legs. Ottawa couldn't capitalize on a two-man advantage for 1:49 as they failed to create any real scoring chances and the game stayed tied. ""That 5-on-3 kill gave us a lot of strength,"" Lehkonen said. ""We found a way in the third period to bounce back and really fight for the win. "" Petry's second then put Montreal at the 9-minute mark as his shot from inside the blue line beat a screened Anderson. NOTES: D Thomas Chabot and LW Matt Puempel were healthy scratches for the Senators for the second straight game. ... Montreal D Zach Redmond, D Mikhail Sergachev and C Brian Flynn were all a healthy scratch. UP NEXT Canadiens: Host defending champion Pittsburgh in their home opener Tuesday night. Senators: At Detroit on Monday night.  ",Ary M,"Karlsson, Sens down Habs 4-3 in the shootout","It wasnêt easy   it never is   but the Sens showed the progress that Coach Boucher promised in their second game of the season. Erik Karlsson continued to be his dominant self, but really, it was the encouraging play of the top-six   again   that helped the team grab the win. It helps that depth players like Chris Wideman and Ryan Dzingel chipped in with a pair of points to start their seasons off on a good note as well.  First Period You could tell that the team wanted to send a message right away in the first, with Marc Methot and Mark Stone landing giant hits on Artturi Lehkonen and Brendan Gallagher respectively. One thing that didnêt change, though, was the teamês tendency to take poor penalties; with Marc Methot taking the teamês first infraction as he stepped up on an unsuspecting Habs player trying to enter the zone and got called for interference. It appears that Boucher wants his left defenders (Methot, Phaneuf, Borowiecki) to be aggressive at the blue-line right away to prevent controlled entries. Part of that has to do with playing to the strengths of the trio, but also to minimize their weaknesses as all three struggle with puck retrieval once the puck is in their defensive zone.  The Habs didnêt manage to get anything on the PK, and instead, it was the Senators who struck first soon afterwards. Erik Karlsson waited for the penalty to end before sending the puck quickly over to Chris Wideman who was waiting on the right-side. Wideman then found Dzingel on the stretch pass, who then utilized his great outside speed to hold off the D and get a shot on Montoya. Crucially, instead of doing a _fly-byÓ after the shot, Dzingel followed up on the puck and tucked Montoyaês poor rebound past him for a 1 - 0 lead six minutes into the first period. Dzingelês speed, a weapon he used all night despite playing only 8 minutes at 5-on-5, is an extra weapon that no other current player in the bottom-six has. This stretch, culminating in the gameês first goal, caps off a 8 - 2 lead in shots for the Sens and was better than any stretch of play from Wednesday nightês win over the Leafs. The Habs finally started to push back at around the 10 minute mark, with some good board work down low on the Sens D and Shea Weber getting his first slapshot in as a Habs player against Ottawa. Max Pacioretty also had his first (and only!) breakaway of the game at the 7:40 mark of the period off of a lob pass, but was defended excellently by the quick pivoting of Erik Karlsson   a skill that allowed him to get inside position on Patches despite the latterês stellar outside speed.  Phil Varone took the teamês second penalty of the period as he bobbled the puck at the defensive blueline and tripped Andrew Shaw while trying to recover. The Habs PP was stronger than their first, with Weber getting around 5 shot attempts by himself on the left point   two of which were bravely blocked by Chris Kelly. Like earlier in the period, the Sens managed to strike back quickly after the successful penalty kill. Chris Wideman had a primary role to play again, as this time, he gathered the puck from a cycling Bobby Ryan at the right point. As Zack Smith settles into the high slot, Wideman flicked the puck hoping for a tip, which he got courtesy of Smithês skate to make it 2 - 0. The Sens had full control at the end of the period: racking up a couple more scoring chances including a beautiful attempt by Mike Hoffman through two Habs defenders, a big hit from Smith on Andrei Markov, and a drawn penalty on Torrey Mitchell as Smith and Ryan attempted to execute a two-on-one during the dying seconds of the period. Funnily enough, both the Hoffman and Smith/Ryan chances came off of poke checks on Shea Weber. Second Period  The Sens looked to build on their 13 - 6 lead in shots at the start of the second, but werenêt able to generate any on the powerplay despite a couple of creative zone entries. Kyle Turris almost scored a couple of goals thanks to some great passes from Mark Stone and Chris Wideman, but missed one and got blocked on the other. Chris Neil and Tomas Plekanec   a duo that was jawing at each other all game -- both took roughing penalties to create a 4-on-4 opportunity that quickly turned into a Sens powerplay after Alex Galchenyuk hooked Dion Phaneuf on the backcheck, but again, the Sens werenêt able to get any quality looks on the powerplay. Luckily enough for them, the Habs only managed to get 2 shots on goal during the first 13 minutes of the second period.  The tide started to shift a bit after Mark Stone got hit and went quickly to the dressing room courtesy of a Jeff Petry shoulder to the head. The play, worrisome because of Stoneês training camp concussion, wasnêt caught by the referees, but Stone quickly made his way back to the bench before missing a shift. The whole ordeal seemed to throw the Sens off though, and after a couple of solid Habs forechecks, Mike Hoffman ended up taking a roughing penalty on the always-swarming Brendan Gallagher. The Sens PK unit played the best that they had all night: extremely aggressive on the puck carrier, stick on puck in the passing lanes, winning 50-50 puck battles, and clearing the puck as soon as they got the chance. Thus, itês ironic that the Habs ended up scoring on it. Near the end of the player advantage, a won draw led to some pitch and catch between Nathan Beaulieu and Jeff Petry. Petry, constantly involved in the game, ended up with the puck near the left faceoff dot and wired it high cross-corner on Craig Anderson. The whole sequence acts as a nice reminder on how PK% sometimes doesnêt tell the whole story as it doesnêt capture sustained pressure whereas things like shot attempts against does a better job. Overall, the period ended with a 23 - 14 shot on goal differential for the Senators, but a 2 - 1 hockey game.  Third Period The Habs first 5-on-5 goal of the period came just three minutes into the third. Fourth liner Phillip Danault forechecked hard and eventually took the puck on a wraparound to try to squeeze it past Anderson. Karlsson charged Danault to prevent him from tucking it in, but Artturi Lehkonen beat his player to the net and poked it by Anderson short side for his first career NHL goal. Itês a poor goal against on Anderson, who has struggled his entire career against wraparounds and was unable to control the rebound to the point where Karlsson actually mouthed _how?Ó after the goal. It was the start of a rough half-a-period for the Captain, who took a hard slash on the wrist from Paul Byron to draw a penalty before getting pushed down by Max Pacioretty on the ensuing man advantage to turn it into a 5-on-3. Unfortunately for our heroes in red, if there was ever a way to gift wrap some momentum for the other team, itês likely a poor 5-on-3. The Sens unit didnêt look awful   they managed to set the puck up well   they just didnêt appear to have a plan put together afterwards. The Habs came out of the successful kill energized, which led to Pacioretty hitting the post and Paul Byron drawing an interference penalty on Dion Phaneuf. On the ensuing powerplay, the Sens are scattered defensively and although they manage to kill the penalty, Jeff Petry scores before Phaneuf can rejoin the play with a massive point shot. Suddenly, the two-goal lead was now a 3 - 2 deficit.  Although Iêm sure that none if this is explicitly Boucherês fault, itês a bad look that the two things the coaching staff focused on in training camp   defence and special teams   ended up being the focus of Games 1 and 2 of the season respectively. Of course, the process is important, and just as the defence improved in Game 2, weêll likely see special teams improvements in the subsequent games, but I just thought it was a fun thing to point out.  It also helps that the Sens were able to tie the game back up at 3. After Petryês go-ahead goal, the Sens opened the game right up and were extremely aggressive offensively. The Habs did a pretty good job of preventing quality scoring chances over the bulk of the last 10 minutes by clogging the neutral zone in order to force dump-ins, but were caught by the Dzingel - Pageau - Pyatt line with two and a half minutes left. Tom Pyatt started and ended the play by creating the zone entry before dishing the puck to Pageau. As Pyatt headed for the net, Pageau touch-passed it to a streaking Ryan Dzingel, who put the puck on a platter for Pyatt to roof past Al Montoya to knot the game at 3. Erik Karlsson played 6:44 of the last 10:08 in regulation time on his way to his game high 30:37 to spearhead the Sens offensive attack as the group ended regulation with a 34 - 22 shot lead   a marked improvement over Game 1. Overtime Unlike Wednesday night against Toronto, neither team managed to score in an exciting overtime session. The Sens took the patient approach again for the second game in a row, as the starting trio of Turris, Stone, and Karlsson took their time in setting up the odd man rush that they aim for in these situations. As a reward for their play, Pyatt and Dzingel got a 3-on-3 shift with Dion Phaneuf that featured a quality scoring chance by Dzingel that was denied by Montoya. Mike Hoffman, on the ice with Mark Stone and Erik Karlsson, likely had the best chance of the extra session off of a sweet feed from Karlsson, but missed the net wide. Hoffman, who had a rough defensive outing against Toronto, was much better tonight and skated swiftly back into the defensive zone in order to force Alexander Radulov onto his backhand on a Habs 2-on-1.  In the shootout, Turris (wrist shot, high blocker) and Radulov (backhand) both scored to start before the next four shooters were denied (Ryan - miss; Pacioretty - stopped five-hole; Brassard - crossbar; Galchenyuk - stopped by Anderson). Interestingly, Karlsson was the next one over the boards and rang the puck off of both posts while scoring blocker side. David Desharnais ended up missing the puck trying to go five-hole and gave the Sens a well-deserved 4 - 3 shootout victory. Sens Hero(es): Ryan Dzingel and Chris Wideman Both played minimal minutes for the second consecutive game as Boucher really limits the ice-time of his fourth line and third pair, but were effective in the time they were on the ice. Dzingel looked sharp for the second straight game, using his speed to create separation from defenders while Wideman utilized his shot well on his way to a 63% shots for percentage at 5-on-5.  Sens Uh-Oh?: Craig Anderson Now, itês only been two games, but itês the second straight one where Olê Chicken Fingers is under a .900 sv% while giving up another bad angle goal. The Sens will be relying heavily on the netminder who has another year left on his current contract, and bet on the fact that his lack of professional experience early on in his career will Çmake upê for his old age. He was strong in the shootout, but will need to be better unless this group can consistently get 3 or 4 goals a game   a hard feat in todayês NHL.   ",Eyes on the Prize,"Petryês heroics, Lehkonenês first goal not enough to top Sens","The Montreal Canadiens headed into the Canadian Tire Centre to take on the Ottawa Senators, without the services of their starting goaltender. Though Carey Price was still sidelined with the flu, Jeff Petry drew into the lineup after recovering from a minor knee injury, and rookie Mikhail Sergachev was scratched to make room. It was a chippy affair early on, as both the Canadiens and Senators focused on physical play in the opening minutes of the opening frame. The undisciplined Senators would head to box first, when Marc Method was sent off for interfering with Torrey Mitchell less than five minutes into the game. However, a disorganized Canadiens squad couldnêt convert on the ensuing power play. Montreal had difficulty setting up in the Senatorsê end, and momentum shifted in Ottawaês favour following their successful penalty kill. Ryan Dzingel sped past Andrei Markov, and beat Al Montoya to put Ottawa on the board first.  Despite the early deficit, the Canadiens regrouped in the second half of the period to put pressure on the Senators. Alex Galchenyuk made a clean lob pass to a streaking Max Pacioretty, but the captain was bumped into Craig Anderson by Erik Karlsson, before he could get his shot off.  Minutes later, Phil Varone was sent off for tripping Andrew Shaw, and Montreal was back on the man advantage. While they still had difficulty setting up in Ottawaês end, their new 1-3-1 setup did end up generating quality scoring opportunities. Shea Weber in particular, had little issue blasting shots in Craig Andersonês direction. Unfortunately for the Canadiens, not a single one could find the back of the net. The bad luck didnêt end there for the Canadiens, as Zack Smithês harmless looking long shot from the point was redirected behind Al Montoya to give the Senators a 2-0 lead. The Senators used the ensuing momentum to continue trapping the Canadiens in their own end and forced Mitchell into taking an ill-timed penalty as the period drew to a close. Though down a man in the second, Montreal had no trouble killing off Mitchellês penalty. Undeterred, the Senators continued to pressure as the period wore on and got a couple of dangerous scoring chances that were turned away by Montoya.  Bad blood continued to flare between the two teams, as both Plekanec and Neil received roughing penalties for their skirmish near the Senatorês bench. The resulting 4-on-4 play almost immediately turned into a 4-on-3 opportunity for Ottawa, after Alex Galchenyuk was sent off slashing Dion Phaneuf. However, Montoyaês steady presence in net and Weberês stellar defensive play limited the Senators to a two goal lead. Sensing that his team wasnêt getting enough scoring chances, coach Michel Therrien opted to juggle his lines. Alex Radulov was promoted to the top line, and briefly found himself skating alongside Pacioretty and Galchenyuk, while Brendan Gallagher took his spot on the second line. The changes seemed to spark the team, and the Canadiens went on to spend more time in Ottawaês end then they had all period.  With Mike Hoffman sent off for roughing a bit past the midway mark, the Canadiens took the opportunity to get back into the game. Jeff Petryês power play tally blew by Craig Anderson, bouncing off the post and into the back of the net, to cut Ottawaês lead to one.  The line juggling didnêt just stop there. Despite putting up a strong showing throughout the game, Artturi Lehkonen was demoted to the fourth line while Paul Byron replaced him on the second. The demotion didnêt deter the Finnish forward, who scored less than four minutes into the third period, poking Danaultês rebound through Anderson to score his first NHL goal, and knotting the game up at two apiece.  Spurred by his goal, the Canadiens quickly went on the offensive. Andrei Markov pounced on an opportunity to drill a hard shot into Anderson, but the Senatorsê goalie was able to keep it out. Not long after, Paul Byron was penalized for slashing Erik Karlsson and the Canadiens were back on the penalty kill. Less than ten seconds after Byronês penalty, Max Pacioretty was also sent off on a questionable holding call, giving the Senators an extended two-man advantage.  Luckily, Montreal was not only able to prevent Ottawa from scoring, but also got a scoring chance of their own when Paciorettyês shot hit the post. Dion Phaneuf would go on to do the Canadiens a favour, taking a well-timed interference penalty to send the Habs back to the power play (despite his best efforts to sell it as Paul Byronês penalty instead). Petry had no qualms taking advantage of the opportunity, putting the Canadiens up 3-2 just as the penalty expired.  Sensing that the game was getting away from them, the Ottawa Senators intensified their efforts to score a tying goal. Though Al Montoya was able to make two great saves to preserve Montrealês lead, Tom Pyatt would beat him with less than three minutes left in the period, tying it up at three and sending the game into overtime. Both Plekanec and Radulov got excellent opportunities to end the game in overtime, but neither player was able to beat Anderson. In the Canadiensê end, Al Montoya was rock solid, and turned away every shot he saw. The extra time was unable to break the deadlock, and the game was sent to a shootout.  Kyle Turris and Alex Radulov both scored for their respective teams, opening the shootout in style. But neither Derick Brassard or Max Pacioretty were able give their teams a lead on the second shot. Erik Karlsson stepped up to take Ottawaês third shot and rang the puck off both the posts and into the net. The Canadiens chose to respond with David Desharnais, but he whiffed on his shot and the Senators skated off with two points. Thoughts It took one and a half games, before the patented blender was on full display. Brendan Gallagher, Alex Galchenyuk and Artturi Lehkonen all found themselves demoted, while Alex Radulov, Tomas Plekanec and Paul Byron found themselves promoted. Lehkonenês demotion was particularly questionable, seeing as the Canadiens controlled over 55% of even-strength shot attempts while he was on the ice. Only the Canadiensê third line remained untouched by the time the game came to an end. Knowing what we know about Michel Therrienês tendencies, this is quite concerning. Speed was a problem on the power play. Though Jeff Petry was able to get the Canadiens on the board on the man advantage, the Habs had difficulty setting up in Ottawaês end, often taking more than half the power play to get into place. The Canadiens also opted to put both Shea Weber and Andrei Markov on the first power play unit, two players who lack foot speed. Should the Senators have gotten a short-handed opportunity against the duo, it would not have been pretty. The Canadiens were lucky to get out of this game with a point. Montreal was out-shot 38 to 24 and only controlled around 44% of even-strength shot attempts (in comparison, Ottawa controlled 56% of even-strength shot attempts).  "

Green scored twice in the first period and his third goal restored a three-goal lead with 6:36 left in the game. Helm scored on a breakaway in between Green's goals in the first period and added a second goal with 2:56 left in the third. Ryan Dzingel's short-handed goal midway through the second period pulled the Senators within two goals. Detroit's Petr Mrazek made 13 of his 31 saves in the second period to keep a relatively comfortable cushion. Andrew Hammond stopped 20 shots in his first start of the season for Ottawa. The Red Wings are leaving the venue they have called home since the 1979-80 season next year for a new arena nearby. Red-and-white clad fans filed into the arena that has been the home of four of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning teams ready to celebrate and they weren't disappointed. After beginning the season with two losses, Detroit looked determined to start strong against the previously unbeaten Senators. Detroit's Jonathan Ericsson fired up the crowd by dropping his gloves and fighting Ottawa's Dion Phaneuf less than 6 minutes into the game. Green gave them plenty of reasons to cheer, too. He entered the game with 120 goals in his career, which began during the 2005-06 season with the Washington Capitals and included a 31-goal season three years later. The Red Wings signed him last year and he had a relatively quiet season with seven goals and 28 assists. NOTES: The Red Wings, playing their first home game since the death of Hall of Famer Gordie Howe, honored the man known as Mr. Hockey with a video tribute during the first break in the game. Fans were asked to stand and to hold up No. 9 signs that were on each seat before the game. The Red Wings also will wear a  9"" on their jerseys. Behind each net,  Howe 9,  is painted in red. Ottawa F Matt Puempel played for the first time this season, replacing Phil Varone in the lineup. UP NEXT Senators: Host Arizona on Tuesday night. Red Wings: Play Wednesday night at the New York Rangers.  ",Michaela Schreiter,Red Wings hand Senators first loss of the season,"We all knew it wouldn't be this easy, didn't we? After going 2-0-0 in their first two games, the Ottawa Senators landed in Detroit to take on the 0-2-0 Red Wings. Despite pre-game predictions tipping heavily in the Sens' favour (based on two games for each team), they would learn very quickly that things aren't so easy. 1st Period Early on in the first period, Mike Green took a hooking penalty, giving Ottawa a chance at their first power-play goal of the season. Despite this opportunity, they would have no such luck. Other than a great defensive play from Erik Karlsson to save a short-handed breakaway by Darren Helm, there wasn't much else to write home about on the first power play of the game. Shortly after the half-way point of the period, Mike Green scored his first goal of the night on a shot from the hash marks that just trickled off Andrew Hammond's glove and into the net. Thomas Vanek picked up the assist on the play, and Detroit was far from finished there. Under three minutes later, Henrik Zetterburg sent a lead pass into the neutral zone, springing Darren Helm on the breakaway. Helm would make no mistake, beating Hammond through the five-hole. After some miscommunication between Dion Phaneuf and Cody Ceci on defensive coverage, Zetterburg found and open lane to an even-more-open Helm. Just like that, it was 2-0 Detroit. With under five minutes to go in the period, Zack Smith took a hooking penalty on Darren Helm (because of course). Unlike the Sens in the first 2 games of the season, Mike Green took advantage of the power play, sending a point shot through both traffic and Hammond, into the back of the net. Detroit would take a penalty before the period ended, giving the Sens a shred of hope heading into the first intermission, but the first period would end with Detroit up 3-0. 2nd Period That shred of hope quickly ran out in the first few minutes of the second period, as the Sens once again found themselves without a goal after a power play. It wasn't long before the tables would turn, when Dion Phaneuf took a roughing penalty, giving Detroit a man advantage. After Tomas Tatar missed a wide open net to the side of Andrew Hammond, Jean-Gabriel Pageau had Ottawa's first short-handed chance of the game. Pageau chased the puck into Detroit's zone, slipped passed the defence, and almost beat Petr Mrazek. Fans hoping for a short-handed goal didn't have to wait too much longer. After Mike Hoffman went to the box for hooking at the half-way mark of the period, Ryan Dzingel fed Kyle Turris in a beautiful 2-on-1 play. Dzingel showed tremendous patience waiting for the defenceman to make a move, and then slid the puck over to Turris. Turris was initially credited with the goal, but that would later change to Dzingel. You be the judge: It only took a few more scrambles in front of the net to kill the penalty. Then, in a scary moment for the Sens, Mark Stone crashed into the net off a bump from Luke Glendening. Stone was slow to get up, and needed to be helped off the ice and into the dressing room. But much to the relief of fans, he returned to the game a few minutes later. Ottawa would end the second period the same way they did the first, on the power play. This came after Mike Green took a very questionable interference call. I think we could have all guessed how that was going to end (hint: without a power-play goal). 3rd Period Things didn't get much better from there for the Sens, starting with a few line scrambles in the third period. The first came when Mark Borowiecki hit Frans Nielsen into the boards in the neutral zone. Riley Sheahan wasn't too much of a fan, and made sure to let Borowiecki know right away. This resulted in a dust-up between the lines, and penalties for both Borowiecki and Sheahan. It wouldn't take long before Chris Neil wanted his turn, making a late move on Mrazek, and dropping the gloves with Justin Abdelkader. Both would (of course) head to the box. In case you haven't seen enough hat tricks from opponents this season (you know, three games in), Mike Green scored his third goal of the game with just under seven minutes left. Another point shot found its way through traffic and right past Hammond. It looked like the game would end with a 4-1 win for Detroit. But wait... there's more! After Marc Methot took a cross-checking penalty with just three minutes remaining in the game, Darren Helm scored to make it 5-1 Detroit. And in their last home opener at the Joe Louis arena, the Red Wings kicked off the Joe's final season with a bang. Sens Killer: Mike Green This one is pretty obvious. Mike Green was the biggest Sens killer tonight. The Detroit defenceman scored three goals, and had a few penalties for good measure. He was one of Detroit's best players, and made things very difficult for the Sens. Honourable Mention: Erik Karlsson He may have only had one assist in a losing effort by his team, but Erik Karlsson had a decent game. Karlsson played stop gap in the neutral zone throughout the game, breaking up plays and intercepting passes before Detroit was able to get into the offensive zone. It may have been a minor move, but it made a big difference at times. Honourable Mention: Shots Call it the participation award of the game, but the Sens weren't terrible in shots allowed. In fact, they managed to get 30 shots on Detroit, while only allowing 25 on the night. A small step, but at least it's a step in the right direction. Sens Zero: Andrew Hammond The Sens may have only allowed 25 shots, but five of those went into the net. That resulted in a .800 SV% for Hammond, which just isn't good enough. It's early in the season, so this could have just been an off night for Hammond, but he will have to be better this year if he wants to be a serviceable back-up goalie. ",Winging It in Motown,"An Ever-Green Night At The Joe: Red Wings 5, Senators 1","Tonight the Red Wings hosted their 36th and final home opener in Joe Louis Arena against long time rival..... .....the Senators?! Like the league couldnêt have scheduled an Original Six team or the Avalanche or even Penguins for this game? Eh, well looking ahead, at least the final regular season home game at The Joe will be against the.... ....DEVILS?!?!?! Anyway, onto the game. First Period The Red Wings came out aggressive, showing some urgency following a disappointing effort to open the season in Florida. Jeff Blashill again juggled lines for the second straight game, only leaving Nyquist and Vanek together through the first three games. The players responded by turning up the pressure on Ottawa, eventually trying to stretch the ice.  Playing a faster style of hockey is part of the identity talk Blashill preached in training camp. Against a slow Ottawa team, the Red Wings are actually looking quicker. OH HEY, A FIGHT. Yes, Jonathan Ericsson and Dion Phaneuf were able to come to life like two enchanted mop buckets in a Disney film and fight each other. The Joe goes wild as it does. Ericsson cleans up on Phaneuf and earns some rare good will.  The Wings already have three fighting majors this season....I donêt know what to do with that information. At 11:43, Vanek is able to force a turnover in deep and chip the puck back up high to Green, who fires a shot off goaltender Andrew Hammondês shoulder then trickles into the net just beyond a cluster of sticks. Initially the thought was Vanek tipped it in off the rebound, but no, just an assist and a continuation to his impressive start as a Red Wing. 1-0 Red Wings (Green (1) from Vanek and Nyquist) Not long after the Vanek goal, and the crowd chanting and buzzing _GORDIE!Ó following a tribute to Gordie Howe during the first TV timeout, Detroit continue to capitalize on momentum.  At 14:15, Helm sprung loose through the neutral zone on a smart line change, then Zetterberg found him with a perfect tape-to-tape pass for a breakaway and snappy finish like it was 2010 all over again. Helm is currently healthy and when heês healthy heês still a damn good player. Probably not as good as his contract extension but still damn good.  2-0 (Helm (1) from Zetterberg and Ouellet) Wrapping up a dominant period, the Red Wings were once again on the power play. At 17:17 they converted, with Green getting his second goal from the top of the slot on a perfect feed from Tatar. Wingsê assistant coach, John Torchettiês preached roatation and quick shots off possession on the power play. This power play was an example of that with lots of work mostly by Vanek down low, opening up space for Green to walk in and snap one in for his second. 3-0 (Green (2) from Tatar and Vanek) Second Period Ottawa continued to be overwhelmed by the Red Wings speed. Iêm constantly seeing the Senators hooking and holding, running the subtle interference teams are always accusing the Red Wings of running. In the first 10 minutes, Phaneuf commits a dangerous roughing penalty on Athanasiou, hitting him from behind, then Mike Hoffman hooked Nyquist. Unfortunately the Hoffman penalty turned into a shorthanded goal for Ottawa. They get on board at 8:51 when Erik Karlsson fetches a rebound deep in his own zone up to Ryan Dzingel, who had an odd man rush, but bounced the puck in off Sheahan past Mrazek. 3-1 (Dzingel (2) from Karlsson) At this point, the pace of the game slowed down into a muck fest. A lot of icings, a lot of stoppages. The Red Wings were no longer stretching the ice. Neither team seemed to be gaining any traction. Third Period The final frame was the first two periods condensed. It featured a grinding style that was seeming suiting Ottawa, but they failed to capitalize on any real chances. It featured the physicality of the first period. This time, noted vermin Chris Neil got into it with Chris Neil wannabe Justin Abdelkader. After Abby landed a couple big hooks to tease the fans, Neil got off the ropes and pulled him down with ease.  The Red Wings now have four fighting majors....I really donêt know what to do with that information. Then if the last opening at Joe Louis Arena wasnêt a big enough moment in itself, Green had to go ahead and add a little more magic. At 13:24, Sheahan went deep into the corner to retrieve the puck, and getting some help from Glendening they won the battle getting it to an open Green, who half-circled to pull traffic to the front of Hammond. He fired home a wrister for his first career hat trick in 652 games. 4-1 (Green (3) from Sheahan and Glendening) After more rough stuff from Ottawa, the Wings shrugged and put the finishing touches on this one. At 17:04 Vanek muscles the puck deep in the corner from a napping Cody Ceci, finding Helm wide open in the Danger Zone for his second goal of the night.  This great set up by Vanek was his third assist of the evening. His mom will have the _playmakerÓ patch sewn on his team jacket so he can wear it to school tomorrow morning.  5-1 (Helm (2) from Vanek) Final 5-1 Red Wings (1-2-0, 8th in Atlantic Division) Not sure if a third game of the season has ever held so much urgency for this franchise. Aside from this historic nature of this game, the idea of the Red Wings starting the season 0-3 felt catastrophic whether or not it really wouldêve been. The Wings responded by coming out fast and tough but disciplined. This game demonstrated a type of hockey the Wings are capable of playing and must play against a division peer like Ottawa.  And while Mike Green is understandably the story tonight, lets not forget about Vanek, whoês dazzled through three games. I donêt expect him to continue a scoring pace of his prime in Buffalo, but I think if he continues to build chemistry with Nyquist, heêll be consistently effective on the power play. Lets just feel good about this one tonight and worry about the next one tomorrow.  "

Five Senators had a goal and an assist each as Ottawa defeated the Arizona Coyotes 7-4 on Tuesday night in front of a sparse crowd of 11,061 at Canadian Tire Centre. The win came a day after a 5-1 loss in Detroit where the Senators seemed sluggish. ""It was a good game to bounce back. We were disappointed with our effort (Monday) night and we had a meeting and talked about the things we need to improve on,"" said Tom Pyatt, who scored late in the first period on Tuesday. ""Tonight was definitely a better effort and we did all the simple things."" Zack Smith had a short-handed goal and Bobby Ryan scored on the power play for the Senators. Mark Stone, Chris Kelly, Kyle Turris and Erik Karlsson, into an empty net, also scored for Ottawa. Mike Hoffman had three assists. Craig Anderson made 31 saves to earn the win. Pyatt, Kelly, Turris, Stone and Karlsson all had two-point nights. ""With the back-to-back and the travel we just wanted to come out, play our game and be consistent with it,"" Turris said. ""We played a much better game but we gave up more shots than we would have liked but we're clicking offensively. It's a work in progress."" Jordan Martinook scored twice for Arizona, including his second at 18:43 just 30 seconds after Turris gave the Senators a 6-3 lead. Tobias Rieder and Oliver Ekman-Larsson had the other goals for the Coyotes. Arizona lost the services of starting goalie Mike Smith seven minutes into the third period when he suffered an injury to his left leg during a scramble in front of the net. ""We'll re-evaluate (Wednesday), but it's too early to get any diagnosis yet. We'll just do our due diligence and find out what it is,"" Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said. Smith, who had stopped 27 of 30 shots before getting hurt, was replaced in the goal by Louis Domingue, who finished with eight saves but surrendered two goals on the first three shots he faced less than a minute after entering the game. Kelly capitalized on a giveaway and beat Domingue from in close at 7:30 and then Stone scored on a rebound at 8:11 giving the Senators a 5-2 lead. Martinook pulled the Coyotes within two at 10:07. Ekman-Larsson had cut the Senators lead to 3-2 with a power-play goal just 61 seconds into the third period. Smith scored a shorthanded goal to give the Senators a 3-1 lead. On his goal Smith got a great backhand pass from Pyatt and scored with a quick shot at 13:04. It was smith 's second goal of the season as he works to try and duplicate his career-high 25 goals from last season. The Coyotes had opened the scoring in the first period when Rieder beat Anderson on a rebound from the slot. The Senators are 3-0-0 at home this season and will host the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday before heading out on a three-game Western swing. The Coyotes continue their season-long six-game road trip in Montreal on Thursday. Smith, who had stopped 27-of-30 shots before getting hurt, was replaced in the goal by Louis Domingue, who surrendered two goals on the first three shots he faced less than a minute after entering the game. Kelly capitalized on a giveaway and beat Domingue from in close at 7:30 and then Stone scored on a rebound at 8:11 giving the Senators a 5-2 lead. Domingue finished with eight saves. Martincook pulled the Coyotes within two at 10:07. Ekman-Larson had cut the Senators lead to 3-2 with a power-play goal just 61 seconds into the third period. Zack Smith scored once shorthanded to give the Senators a 3-1 lead and in the final minute of the period he broke in alone on Mike Smith but his backhand shot went wide. On his goal Smith got a great backhand pass from Pyatt and scored with a quick shot at 13:04. It was smith 's second goal of the season as he works to try and duplicate his career high 25 goals from last season. ""The execution wasn't that good and it's something we have to clean up,"" Tippett said. ""The difference in the game was we didn't execute very well and we've got some guys that aren't competing as hard as they need to compete."" NOTES: Senators scratches were Matt Puempel and Phil Varone while Jacob Chychrun, Jamie McGinn and Christian Dvorak were scratches for the Coyotes. . The Senators' first goal Tuesday snapped an 0-for-9 start to their power play this season. . Along with Strome, Senators defenseman Thomas Chabot was also making his NHL debut Tuesday night. UP NEXT: The Coyotes continue their season-long six-game trip in Montreal on Thursday. The Senators are 3-0-0 at home this season and will host Tampa Bay on Saturday before heading out on a three-game Western swing.  ",Ary M,"Hoffman, Pyatt help Sens round up ÇYotes, 7 - 4","Remember when games against the Coyotes used to be boring, or ended up in Mikkel Boedker hat-tricks? This one was anything but, with 11 goals, and a combined 77 shots and 100 attempts on net. First Period We started with a bit of deja vu to last nightês game against Detroit, in which the Sens started well, but gave up the first goal on a bad play from their goaltender. The first 10 minutes were almost all Sens, with Methot and Tommy Pyatt getting a couple of scoring chances, and the team successfully killing off a(nother) Dion Phaneuf penalty after the blueliner took down Max Domi in front of the Sens net. The ÇYotes started to go to work around the 10 minute mark, using their cycle game down low to penetrate the Sens defence and generate wraparound chances to Craig Anderson. The first goal was eereily similar to last nightês, where Arizonaês kids (Reider, Strome, Duclair) cycled off of the pairing of Phaneuf - Ceci. The puck ends up at the point, where Connor Murphy nicely one-touched it to Dylan Strome, who quickly fires it on net. Craig Anderson, perhaps borrowing Andrew Hammondês glove, is unable to catch the puck, and Tobias Reider is the first on it to deposit it behind the Sens netminder.     Unlike last night, the Sens quickly respond, with Coach Boucherês favourite line of Pageau - Kelly - Pyatt and the teamês first pair. The momentum shift eventually results in a Ryan White interference penalty on Chris Neil with 6:23 to go, and for the first time, the Sens cash in on the powerplay. Off of a set play, Brassard wins the faceoff at the left dots and Karlsson quickly passes it to Hoffman, who wires it on net. The puck hits Bobby Ryan, who listened to Coach Boucher and crashed the net, and ends up past Mike Smith for a PP goal 4 seconds in.   Crucially, the Sens keep pushing and score again off of another play that Boucher has been stressing. Marc Methot wheels behind the net to grab a loose puck and quickly skates it out for the controlled exit. He quickly delivers a bullet pass to Ryan Dzingel, who enters the zone and tries to flip the puck to a streaking Jean-Gabriel Pageau in the middle of the ice. The pass doesnêt make it to Pageau, but hits Martin Hanzalês stick and ends up with Tom Pyatt, who backhands it over Smith for a go-ahead goal 95 seconds after the Sens tied the game up. Because the pass hit off of an opponentês stick, Dzingel and Methot donêt end up with assists on the play, but were surely deserving of one.   Second Period The second started the opposite way of the first, in the sense that the Coyotes jumped out of the gate before the Sens rebounded and played the final ~10 minutes to a tie possession-wise. It starts, again, with strong cycle shifts on the Phaneuf - Ceci pair with Jordan Martinook getting a couple of quality scoring chances. The Sens start to fight back after Mark Stone, who was hit hard all night, and Connor Murphy take coinciding minors and force the game into some 4-on-4 action. Here, Ottawa uses their speed with players like Dzingel, Hoffman, and Karlsson shining and the team forcing Smith into 3 nice pad saves. After the penalties expire, the game settles down. In my opinion, this favoured Ottawa more as they started to prevent shots against and close down gaps to prevent the Coyotes from creating anything with their speed. In turn, the trio of Hoffman - Turris - Stone started to get more offensive zone time and force turnovers to generate chances. Arizona finally sees some light after Chris Neil goes off for interference with 7:20 left after hitting Radim Vrbata late, but the Sens manage to turn it into something positive. The Sens PKers converge on the ÇYotes entry through the middle and Cody Ceci manages to poke the puck to Zack Smith. Smith quickly gets it to Pyatt, who begins to drive wide, while Zack engages in a footrace with Shane Doan through the middle of the ice. Smith ends up using his speed to win the middle and has time to get his stick ready to perfectly one-time a pass from Pyatt past Mike Smith for the teamês second shorthanded goal of the year.   Unfortunately for our heroes in red, the period doesnêt end on a good note. With 45 seconds left, Dylan Strome is taken down by a backchecking Bobby Ryan, and soon after, Chris Kelly trips Max Domi in the high slot to give the Coyotes a 5-on-3 to start the third. Third Period How did 3 - 1 become 7 - 4? Itês like all of the evenness of the first two periods went into the wind from the beginning of the period. First, on the 5-on-3, Oliver Ekman-Larsson shows why he scored 21 goals last year by wiring a slap shot high glove past Craig Anderson to make it 3 - 2. Crucially, the ÇYotes 5-on-3 did a really good job of spreading out the Sens PK triangle by moving the puck swiftly from high to low, then back to high while still having a screen in front of Anderson (*cough* take note Sens 5-on-3 unit *cough*) The Sens manage to kill the 53 seconds left on the powerplay, and the game opens up right afterwards. After Ekman-Larsson and Hoffman exchange chances, Derrick Brassard sets up Zack Smith and Erik Karlsson for two of the Sens 8 high danger scoring chances in the period. The key moment of the game, for me, came off of a strange looking play where Tom Pyatt dug the puck out of the low corner and passed it to Chris Kelly, who was waiting quietly in the slot. Kellyês shot beats Mike Smith, hits both posts, but stays out. In turning for the puck though, Smith seems to twist something in his left knee and screamed audibly for the trainer. Arizonaês backup, Louis Domingue, comes in and due to NHL rules, doesnêt get a chance to warm-up. Now, Iêm not saying itês because of that, but poor Çol Domingue lets in two goals in 52 seconds to give the Sens a 5 - 2 lead with 10 minutes to play. The first goal was a bit of revenge from Chris Kelly, who handled a poor Marty Hanzal turnover in the slot and wired it past Domingue for his first goal in a Sens uniform in five years. The second goal is Mark Stoneês first of the season, and like he always does, Stone did most of the work himself. First, he dumped the puck into the left corner for retrieval, which the ever-loyal Kyle Turris does. From there, itês a quick flick to Domingueês left pad which he spits out right to Stone, who puts the rebound.    S The celebrations donêt last long, though, as two minutes later, the ÇYotes respond courtesy of a learning moment from Thomas Chabot. The Sens rookie receives the puck in the defensive zone and is skating with it under control, but for some reason, he goes to make a bank pass to a streaking Sens forward and is intercepted by Alex Goligoski. Gogo quickly gets the puck to Jordan Martinook, who finally pots what seems like his 4th scoring chance past Anderson stick-side to bring the score to 5 - 3. The second biggest moment of the period came courtesy of the Sens PK, who were excellent tonight despite giving up the 5-on-3 goal. Two shifts after Martinookês goal, Cody Ceci turns the puck over to Shane Doan, who tries to create a chance for Max Domi but the rookie forward is taken down by a recovering Ceci, who gets called for interference. On the ensuing kill, the Sens are hyper aggressive and donêt let the Coyotes set up, resulting in no shots on net. Interestingly, for any Karlsson detractors who read a Sens blog, the Captain played a team high 5:10 on the PK tonight and performed extremely well. Itês like heês always been good defensively and has the best stick on the team while also having the speed to win puck battles and the hockey IQ to read plays. Who knew! With momentum after the kill, the Sens manage to take the play to the Coyotes and are led by Hoffman - Turris - Stone, who end up potting another goal. This time, itês Kyle Turris whoês a beneficiary of a Mike Hoffman pass (his third assist of the night), as the New Westminster native wires a shot top-shelf by Domingue to give the Sens a 6 - 3 lead. Jordan Martinook responds again with a deflection goal off of another defensive miscue by the Senators, this time via the failed puck clearance of Cody Ceci, to make it 6 - 4.  However, all this does (other than decrease Craig Andersonês already poor save percentage), is create an opportunity for some Sens history. Erik Karlsson, on the ice for the last minute of the game, blocks a shot and then powers through two Coyotes players to win a race for the puck in order to pot an empty net goal and become the Sens all-time leader in goals by a defenseman with 102. Just watch the gif below over and over and over and over: Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman The Sens best forward tonight in all areas of the ice, Hoffman was singled out by Coach Boucher in his post-game comments as a player whoês been using his speed constantly. 3 assists, 8 shots on goal, and supporting his linemates to all have a >60% CF% at 5-on-5 tonight are definitely good signs. Sens Hero(es): The speedy trio of Zack Smith, Ryan Dzingel, and Tommy Pyatt When Clarke MacArthur went down, we knew that the Sens depth players would have to step up. I donêt think anyone wouldêve been able to guess at the level of production weêd see right off the bat, though. Smith had a shorthanded goal, Dzingel generated two goals (despite no points), while Pyatt had a goal and an assist while leading forwards in PKTOI. Importantly, all three seem to have bought into Boucherês system the most, and Smith & Pyatt are trusted in all situations while Dzingel is surely getting to that point. Surely, it helps Pyattês case that heês the most acquainted with Boucherês system, and we canêt expect him to continue putting up points, but itês definitely helping the teamês case to start off the year. Sens Zero: Cody Ceci When Cody Ceci was on the ice tonight at 5-on-5, the Senators generated 11 shot attempts for and gave up 29. If you care about scoring chances (as per Natural Stat Trick), Ceci was on the ice for 15 (!!!) against in ~21 minutes of play tonight. He was surprisingly an even in +/-, which tells you more about that stat than the quality of his play. To me, it just looks like he tries to get rid of the puck as fast as possible, and consistently puts it into poor plays on the ice. He will sometimes look good because of his skating and hard slap shot, but canêt ever get himself into a position to use those two skillsets effectively. Itês hard to blame the kid when Bryan Murrayês rushing him surely didnêt help, but how many more mistakes can the team take with Ceci playing such important minutes on the team? ",Five For Howling,Mike Smith injured in Arizona Coyotesê 7-4 loss in Ottawa,"Dylan Strome was obviously disappointed to not play in the Arizona Coyotesê season opener. But when his number was called tonight against the Ottawa Senators, he made the most of it. Strome recorded his first NHL point on Arizonaês opening goal of the night, but as the game progressed all eyes focused on the other end of the ice, as Mike Smith left with what appeared to be a significant injury as the Coyotes fell 7-4. Scoring Summary First Period 1-0 Arizona - Tobias Rieder is back to form with the Coyotes as he showed up at the right place and the right time to bang home a rebound created by Dylan Stromeês high-slot point shot. Assists to Strome and Connor Murphy on the goal at 12:18. 1-1 Tie - Ottawa needed just four seconds to score on its first power play of the night. Erik Karlsson fed Mike Hoffman in the high point, who bounced a wrist shot off of Bobby Ryan and past Mike Smith. Assists to Hoffman and Karlsson on the power play goal at 13:41. 2-1 Ottawa - Shortly after scoring the power play goal, Ottawa took advantage of a very sloppy defensive effort by Martin Hanzal, Kevin Connauton, and Jamie McBain. The puck bounced between all three Coyotesê defenders and to the stick of Tom Pyatt, who easily snuck the puck behind Mike Smith. No assists on the goal at 15:16. Second Period 3-1 Ottawa - Strome coughed up the puck at center-ice on a Coyotesê power play , which lead to a Senators two-on-one. Oliver Ekman-Larsson committed to play the shot, and Tom Pyatt found Zack Smith for the shorthanded tally. Assists to Tom Pyatt and Cody Ceci on the shorthanded goal at 13:04. Third Period 3-2 Ottawa - After Arizona received a five-on-three opportunity at the end of the second period, the Coyotes took it into the third. Oliver Ekman-Larsson was the beneficiary of a Martin Hanzal screen, and his wrist shot brought the Coyotes to within one. Assists to Shane Doan and Alex Goligoski on the power play goal at 1:01. 4-2 Ottawa - After Mike Smith left the game with an injury, the Senators wasted no time welcoming Louis Domingue to the ice. Martin Hanzal coughed the puck up in the defensive end, and Chris Kelly pounced on it just twelve seconds after Domingue came in. No assists on the goal at 7:30. 5-2 Ottawa - As if the first play Domingue faced wasnêt bad enough, the Coyotes were not able to keep the crease clear. Kyle Turrisê initial shot was stopped by Domingue, and Mark Stone was there to knock home the rebound. Assists to Turris and Hoffman on the goal at 8:11. 5-3 Ottawa - Arizona finally stopped the bleeding, as Alex Goligoski did a tremendous job keeping the puck in at the blue-line and finding Jordan Martinook unattended at the far-side faceoff circle. Martinook rifled a shot past Anderson to pull the Coyotes back within two. Assist to Goligoski on the goal at 10:07. 6-3 Ottawa - Because fate wanted this game to be as cruel to the Coyotes as possible, Kyle Turris scored a goal of his own on a Mike Hoffman feed cross-ice. Assists to Hoffman and Mark Stone on the goal at 18:13. 6-4 Ottawa - Arizona still kept up the fight, as Jordan Martinook lodged his second of the game by bouncing the puck in off of Senatorsê rookie defenseman Thomas Chabot. Assists to Connor Murphy and Brad Richardson on the goal at 18:43. 7-4 Ottawa - With the Coyotesê net empty, Erik Karlsson blocked a Max Domi slapshot and then proceeded to beat Domi and every other Coyote up ice to score the empty-netter. Assist to Chris Kelly on the empty-net goal at 19:47. Three Answers 1. Can the rookies keep it up?  Dylan Strome took less than a period to record his first NHL point, an assist after Tobias Rieder batted home a beautiful wrist shot. Strome did an excellent job getting the puck on net on that play. If anything, it was the Coyotesê veterans who needed to step up. Martin Hanzal coughed up a brutal turnover 12 seconds after Domingue came in, and Connor Murphy let Kyle Turris get inside position on Domingue on the Stone goal less than a minute later. 2. Will the special teams keep it up? The Coyotes conceded a goal on their first penalty kill of the game, while the power play only converted once in five opportunities. Arizona had a power play late in the third period that could have brought the score to within one, but were unable to convert. 3. Can the Coyotes keep a lead this time? After jumping out to a 1-0 lead, the Coyotes surrendered two goals in quick succession. They had a fighting chance at climbing all the way back, but the Mike Smith injury and subsequent meltdown absolutely killed Arizona. Players of the Game Arizona - Jordan Martinook - Martinook played an all-around solid game, but it was his two goals in the third period that stopped the bleeding for the Coyotes and gave them a fighting chance.  Ottawa - Mike Hoffman - Hoffman had three assists on the night and was instrumental in creating scoring chances for his teammates all night long. Paw Prints For the Ottawa Senators perspective, check out Silver Seven. Christian Dvorak and Jakob Chychrun sat this game out as Strome and Kevin Connauton drew in for the first time this season. Jamie McGinn remained scratched with injury issues. The Coyotes are hoping both he and Michael Stone will be ready to play at some point during this road trip. Mike Smith left in the third period with an apparent leg injury. There was no official word about his status other than that he would be re-evaluated tomorrow, but his reaction suggests it is not good. Arizona finished behind in the shot count 42-35 after outshooting the Senators 27-24 through two periods.  "

A strong performance against the Senators was definitely a step in the right direction. Andrei Vasilevskiy made 27 saves, Vladislav Namestnikov and Steven Stamkos scored early in the second period, and the Lightning beat the Senators 4-1 Saturday night. Alex Killorn and Valtteri Filppula also scored for the Lightning, who were playing their first road game of the season.  For probably 40-50 minutes it was the best we've played all season,  Stamkos said.  The first 20 minutes was definitely the most dominating and you build on that.  Chris Neil scored the lone goal for the Senators, and Craig Andersonstopped 31 shots.  It's clear we're just not there yet,  Senators coach Guy Boucher said.  We've got work to do. We showed we were able to play with them at times, but to be able to compete with a team that's expected to compete for the Stanley Cup we definitely have more work to do.  Anderson was solid for much of the game for the Senators, but Killorn was able to sneak one through his right arm to give the Lightning a 3-1 lead midway through the third. It was Killorn's fourth goal of the season. Filppula made it 4-1 late in the third.  They came out and played a better game than we did right from the start,  Ottawa's Erik Karlsson said.  Unfortunately that's the way it's going to be some times. We didn't have our best today.  Boucher said part of the problem was trying to force plays.  It's what hurt us in the first and killed us in the third,  he said.  We were a lot better in the second when we played with speed and pressure and stopped trying to make plays where there were none.  Namestnikov opened the scoring 2:36 into the second with the man advantage.  We came out and got the lead for the first time this year which was nice.  Tampa made it 2-0 at the six-minute mark, on the power play again, as Namestnikov made a cross-crease pass to Stamkos, who ripped it past Anderson. The Senators challenged the goal believing the play was offside, but after a lengthy review the goal stood.  Our start was fine,  Anderson said.  We got out of the first period 0-0 then got into a little penalty trouble. The (penalty kill) just didn't get the job done. I'm a big part of that. My job there is to be a big part of that PK, and I wasn't good enough.  . The Senators managed to get on board with 4:33 left in the middle period as Neil picked up his own rebound. Vasilevskiy made the initial save, but wasn't able to freeze the puck and Neil got a stick on it. NOTES: D Thomas Chabot and LW Matt Puempel were healthy scratches for the Senators. ... D Matt Taormina was a healthy scratch for Tampa Bay. ... This marked the first time Ottawa coach Guy Boucher faced his old team since being fired from the Lightning in 2013. UP NEXT Lightning: At Toronto on Tuesday night in the second game of a five-game trip. Senators: At Vancouver on Tuesday night in the opener of a three-game trip to western Canada.",Ary M,Lightning show why they're elite; strike four times to beat Sens 4 - 1,"In his pre-game availability, Guy Boucher tampered expectations for tonight despite the Sens 3 - 1 - 0 start, calling his ex-team one of the favourites to win the Cup. The game sure played out that way, as outside of a stretch during the back half of the second period, the Lightning were strong tonight.  The game started poorly for the Sens, with the Lightning jumping out to a 10 - 2 lead in shots after the first 10 minutes of play. In a Fox Sports intermission interview, Anton Stralman was asked what the Lightning were doing different compared to their last game, a 4 - 0 blanking on home ice. His response? The team was attacking as a unit, using speed through the neutral zone, and having the defensemen jump up to create a second line of attack. Iêm sure thatês the gameplan for most teams on a good night, but it also sounds strikingly familiar to how Boucher would like the Sens to play as well.  Instead, outside of the Pageau - Kelly - Pyatt line and the magnificent play of Craig Anderson, the Sens got a whole Çlotta nothing in the first. They were 25% on faceoffs, gave the puck away 6 times (compared to 1 for Tampa Bay), and in particular, the Hoffman - Turris - Stone group were on the ice for 6 scoring chances against in ~4 minutes of ice-time, compared to 1 chance for.  The second started the same way, only with some goals against sprinkled in as the team started to take penalties - an early season plague for the group to cure. This time, Cody Ceci was caught chasing the puck and took a high-sticking penalty in the corner, but was back on the ice 11 seconds later as Vladislav Namestnikov tipped home an Anton Stralman wrist shot in the high slot to give the Bolts the lead. Two and a half minutes later, Mike Hoffman gets caught hooking Stralman on the backcheck after the Bolts rearguard entered the offensive zone, and the Lightning score again. Now, the penalty kill did a better job at the beginning, forcing the Bolts to either dump the puck in or forechecking hard to prevent the zone entry. However, everything collapsed after the Bolts top unit, featuring the likes of Hedman, Stamkos, Drouin, and Namestnikov, went to work. Itês clear when players like Stamkos and Ovechkin set-up in the left circle that you know the powerplay is going to try to get the puck to them, but itês still ridiculous how often they still manage to score. This time, Marc Methot ended up late reacting to a bobbled puck at the right half-wall and Vlad Namestnikov earned his second point in as many minutes by sliding a sweet cross-ice pass through the crease to Stamkos, who one-timed it past a sprawling Craig Anderson to make it 2 - 0.  The Sens fortunes finally started to change around the 10 minute mark of the period when Erik Karlsson and Tom Pyatt drew back-to-back hooking penalties. The Sens powerplay   still dormant after a 0/3 night tonight   didnêt score, but generated good zone time that carried over into a strong back half of the period at 5-on-5. All four Senators lines, not just the Pageau - Kelly - Pyatt trio, got some great shifts in and generated pressure, but it was the unlikely fourth line who potted the teamês only goal of the night. It started with Chris Kelly, on a double-shift, chipping the puck into the zone and on net. Chris Neil, crashing the net hard, then outmuscled a couple of Lightning players to pot the loose puck behind Vasilevskiy after the Russian netminder couldnêt track it properly to get the Sens on the board, 2 - 1.  The Sens pushed hard to tie the game before the end of the period, with Chris Kelly in the middle of all of it on his way to being on the ice for a game-high 9 scoring chances, but didnêt score. The push back was very evident, however, and was a positive on a generally poor night for the team as a whole.  The third period was pretty even, with the Point - Filppula - Killorn lines and the Pageau - Kelly - Pyatt lines trading chances early. Momentum swung back the Lightningês way though after J.T. Brown drew a holding penalty against Mark Borowiecki. Although the Sens PK got their first kill of the night, they were rattled and were hemmed into their zone for the 2 - 3 shifts afterwards, culminating in a goal against. It started with a failed zone entry for the Hoffman - Turris - Stone line that sends the Lightning with numbers the other way. Dion Phaneuf ends up backing up too much, leaving too big of a gap and a ton of time for Alex Killorn to pick his spot on Craig Anderson to give the Bolts a 3 - 1 lead.  Karlsson, who played a majority of the last 10 minutes of the third on his way to a game-high 25:33, tried to get his team back in it after drawing a holding penalty against Namestnikov, but both units (Phaneuf - Wideman on Unit 2) were unable to score despite good movement. In particular, what Iêve noticed about the Sens PP is that thereês good movement, but a lot of it is along the perimeter and thereês very little cross-ice passes that lead to the isolated 2-on-1s that the team needs to generate in order to get high danger scoring chances. If what Boucher ran in the pre-season is any indication, the Sens are definitely trying to do what Iêm talking about (theyêre 5th in the league in 5-on-4 shot attempts per 60 minutes), but have been unable to execute so far this season.  The final goal against came off of a bobbled pass by Kyle Turris after Karlsson tried to spring him to start a neutral zone rush. The puck ends up on Brayden Pointês stick, who quickly sent up to Val Filppula for a breakaway that Craig Anderson had no chance on.  All in all, it just seemed like the Sens couldnêt find a way to generate a consistent attack, measured by pucks directed towards the net. 35 shots against and two powerplay goals against surely didnêt help their cause, although playing the Bolts around even in 5-on-5 scoring chances (17 to 20) is a positive to build off of. The loss ends the teamês three game home winning streak AND Karlssonês four game point streak, as the Sens will look to rebound on the road as they begin a Western Canada road trip.  Sens Hero: Chris Kelly Olê Stonehands had a fantastic night tonight. Not only did he lead the team in shot attempts for with 59%, but he had numerous individual scoring chances and was on the ice for 9 (compared to 4 against). I was skeptical that heêd have anything left in the tank after the team signed him to a one-way deal in the offseason, but he can keep taking a regular shift if he continues to play this way.  Honourable Mention: Craig Anderson Iêm pretty conflicted about this choice. On one hand, Anderson kept the team in it during a terrible first period and itês pretty hard to fault him for any of the teamês goals. On the other?  ",Raw Charge,Lightning bounce back from an ugly loss and beat the Senators 4-1,"After being shut out at home 4-0 by the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, the Lightning shuffled their lines and came out with a lot of energy against the Ottawa Senators. This was the first time the Lightning have faced former head coach Guy Boucher as he returned from a stint in Europe with SC Bern to take the head coaching job with the Senators. First Period During the morning skate, head coach Jon Cooper had greatly mixed up the lines after the 4-0 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. During the pre-game line rushes, the lines were the same as they had been when the Lightning started the game against Colorado. Cooper then sent Cedric Paquette, Brian Boyle, and J.T. Brown out to start the game, which was not a line during morning skate. However, we soon saw the actual line changes. The fourth line stayed the same as it had been with Paquette, Boyle, and Brown. The first line saw Vladislav Namestnikov, Steven Stamkos, and Nikita Kucherov lined up together. The second line was made up of Ondrej Palat, Tyler Johnson and Jonathan Drouin. The only change on the third line was Alex Killorn on the left wing for Valtteri Filppula and Brayden Point. Throughout much of the first period, the Lightning controlled the play. Through 16 minutes of play, the Senators had only managed 2 shots on goal while the Lightning had 12 shots. Every line for the Lightning was getting chances. The success was not limited to just one or two lines.  Brian Boyle left the game late in the first period after taking a stick to the face. The replay showed that Senators goaltender Craig Anderson caught him up high while swinging his stick around from behind him. The high stick went uncalled by the referees. Boyle returned for the second period. The first period ended scoreless with the Lightning leading shots 14 to 4 and no penalties being called. Five Bolts were tied with two shots a piece: Killorn, Drouin, Namestnikov, Stamkos, and Anton Stralman. Forward line TOI was also pretty evenly spread without any special teams play. Brown was the lowest at 4:07 with Stamkos the highest at 6:09. On the blue line, the story was pretty much the same with Sustr the lowest with 5:47 and Hedman leading with 8:17. Second Period The Senators gave up the first penalty of the game when Cody Ceci got called for high sticking Drouin. The Lightning struck quick just 11 seconds in to the power play. Stralman took a shot from the point that Palat deflected, and then the puck bounced off Namestnikov and into the net. The assist to Stralman was his first on the year and 150th in his career. It didnêt take long for the Lightning to get their second goal of the night as Stralman drew a hooking call while entering the zone. After an attempt by Kucherov and a scramble, Namestnikov collected the puck and passed it across to Stamkos for a one timer. However, Ottawa would challenge the goal for offsides as Tyler Johnson was close to being offsides as the puck entered the zone. However, Toronto confirmed that the play was onside and it was ruled a good goal. The Lightning gave up two penalties in a row, but were able to kill off both. However, that sequence gave Ottawa some momentum and they were able to get on the board with a greasy goal from the hated Chris Neil. Neil put the puck on net and Vasilevskiy made the save. The puck bounced out in front of him and Garrison tried to put the puck under Vasilevskiy. The puck squirted out behind him and Neil was able to get his stick around and put the puck in before Hedman could tuck it under Vasilevskiy. The second half of the period saw the momentum swing very heavily towards Ottawaês favor as the chart from HockeyStats.ca below shows. The two power plays and the Neil goal gave them new life and it took some time for the Lightning to get off their heels. The second period came to and end with the Lightning up 2-1, but Ottawa had closed the gap in shots on goal by outshooting the Lightning 16-8. The period ended with the Lightning up in shots 22-20. Third Period The third period started out a bit more evenly with a back and forth flow. The Lightning got their third power play of the game as Brown got pulled down trying to split the D. While the Lightning generated chances on the power play, they failed to get an insurance goal. The Filppula line with Killorn and Point came on at the end of the power play and the game went to a commercial break after an offside play. Their line stayed out after the commercial break and Killorn found the back of the net on the far side after a nice set up from Filppula. While the Lightning gave Ottawa some life with a holding call on Namestnikov, the play remained fairly even for much of the middle part of the third period. With only two minutes to play, Brayden Point intercepted the puck just outside of his own blue line and passed the puck up to Filppula who had just come off the bench. Filppula came down the right wing side all alone and roofed the puck over Anderson to give the Lightning a 4-1 lead and the final score. Conclusions This was a great bounce-back game after getting shut out by Colorado. The Lightning dominated during the first period even though they couldnêt find the back of the net. Theyêll have to wait another game to see if they can break their drought of first period goals. However, this was the first game of the season where they had scored first. The new lines looked good and I expect weêll see them continue into next game. The beginning of the season is always a mix and match situation until the right lines are found. While theyêre hot, coaches runs with them. If they get cooled down, coaches break them up and try something new until they find something that works. Vasilevskiy was sound tonight. He made a lot of great saves to keep the Lightning in it and to not let the momentum shift in the second period. The one goal he let in was the result of some hard work by Chris Neil and a little bit of bad luck with the puck squirting through him. Otherwise, he had a fantastic night. Tyler Johnson led all Lightning forwards with 19:03 time on ice. Hedman led the defense with 22:51. The top three forward lines for the Lightning were pretty evenly spread out with Brayden Point continuing to get in the 14 minute range. The defense was also rolled pretty well and Coach Bowness kept Hedmanês minutes manageable to keep him fresh for this extended road trip. Next up, the Lightning will travel to Toronto and take on the Maple Leafs on Tuesday night at 7:30 pm. Weêll be back live tweeting the game on Twitter along with the Preview, Game Day Thread for discussions, and a recap of (hopefully) another Lightning win. GO BOLTS!  "

The second-year forward had the first two-goal game of his career and Craig Anderson made 22 saves Tuesday night as Ottawa defeated the Vancouver Canucks 3-0. Dzingel suited up alongside Derick Brassard and Bobby Ryan after spending the first five games of the season on the fourth line, and the speedy wing made the most of his opportunity. ""It was easy to play with those guys. They're great NHLers and great people,"" Dzingel said. ""Two good friends, and to be honest I just had a lot of fun out there - just trying not to get in their way. ""I was proud to play with those two guys. "" The 24-year-old split time between Ottawa and the AHL last season, registering three goals and six assists in 30 NHL games. He already has four goals and two assists through six games this season. ""The whole summer I didn't just focus on just making the team,"" said the native of Wheaton, Illinois. ""I came to make a difference. My mindset was not to just be good enough, it was to be better. "" Dzingel said moving up the lineup would have been more difficult if he didn't already have great relationships off the ice with both Ryan and Brassard. He showed up early to training camp and lived with Ryan for a time before moving into brassard 's house once the season started. ""There aren't any nerves when you know how good they are,"" Dzingel said. ""I just had to play my game. "" Anderson entered play with a 3.66 goals-against average and an .866 save percentage but was flawless as Ottawa (4-2-0) opened a three-game road trip through western Canada with a solid defensive effort that was capped by Jean-Gabriel pageau 's empty-net goal. ""I felt as the game went on I was progressively getting better,"" said Anderson, who picked up his first shutout of the season and the 34th of his career. ""The way we played defensively allowed me to only have to make one or two big saves and when that's the case, usually you can have a pretty good game. "" Ryan Miller made 25 stops for Vancouver (4-2-1), which has lost three straight and lost at home for the first time. ""They were hard on the puck,"" Miller said. ""We started to make some adjustments. You have to be ready for that kind of stuff. "" After opening the scoring in the first period, Dzingel doubled Ottawa's lead at 2:12 of the third, taking a slick no-look feed from Ryan in front and beating Miller. ""Since Day 1 at every practice and every game he's shown that he wants to be here, that he's ready to survive in the NHL before contributing offensively,"" first-year Senators head coach Guy Boucher said. ""He came here with the right attitude of: `I'm staying here, I'll block shots, I'll kill penalties, I'll backcheck, I'll do whatever I need to do to be on this team and pay the price.' He's getting all the rewards. "" Ottawa had surrendered nine goals in third periods coming into Tuesday, and Anderson had to be sharp on a shot off the stick of Bo Horvat from the slot with about 12 minutes left in regulation. Anderson then stopped Sven Baertschi on a breakaway - one of just three Vancouver shots in the third - with six minutes to go to preserve the shutout before Pageau scored his first with Miller on the bench for an extra skater. ""I think our players are absolutely buying in,"" said Boucher, who is still in the process of implementing his system. ""I love the willingness to pay attention to small details and how to be unselfish. "" Ottawa carried the play for much of the first period and led 1-0 on Dzingel's third of the season at 7:38 after the Senators jumped on a Canucks' turnover in the neutral zone. Miller stopped brassard 's initial shot on a 2-on-2 rush with Vancouver's forwards in the middle of a change, but Dzingel was right there for the rebound. Notes: Troy Stecher made his NHL debut for Vancouver after being called up from the AHL on Monday. The 22-year-old signed with the organization as a undrafted college free agent in the offseason, and took the place of Christopher Tanev (lower-body injury) alongside Alexander Edler on Vancouver's top defense pairing. ... Ottawa snapped a seven-game losing streak at Rogers Arena dating to 2004. ... Also missing for Vancouver were Fs Alexandre Burrows (neck) and Derek Dorsett (shoulder). Jayson Megna was recalled from the AHL and suited up for his first game with the club on the fourth line. UP NEXT: Senators: Visit Calgary on Friday. Canucks: host Edmonton on Friday and Washington on Saturday, but after that play just seven of their next 21 at home.  ",Ross A,"Dzingel, Anderson lead Sens past Canucks","Coming into training camp, there was some question as to which players would make the team in bottom-six roles. Tom Pyatt, Matt Puempel, Nick Paul, Ryan Dzingel, Max McCormick, and Phil Varone all had their sites set on a couple of openings. Now, thereês essentially no question. Dzingel continued his incredible start, scoring both of the goals that Ryan Millerallowed en route to a 3-0 shutout of the Vancouver Canucks. The first goal was just the result of some nice effort by Dzingel. He picked up the puck in the neutral zone, dropped it to Derick Brassard, and then got to the net to put home an easy rebound. His speed and his ability to drive the net showed on the play. Ottawa outshot the Canucks 11-7 in the first. The second period didnêt feature any scoring, but it wasnêt for lack of trying. Vancouver outshot the Sens 12-7 in the period, and only some timely saves by Craig Anderson held them off the scoresheet. I thought in particular the Sedins showed that even at age 36, they are dangerous players on the cycle. Full credit to Guy Boucherês system in the third period. With the game on the line, the Sens held the Canucks to just three shots on goal. Vancouver may not be the leagueês best team, but itês still an impressive feat to hold off a team fighting for the win like that. Dzingel got his second of the game off a beautiful, beautiful feed by Bobby Ryan. Miller had no chance, and Dzingel cemented his place as first star of the game. With Vancouverês goalie pulled, the reunited trio of Mark Stone - Zack Smith - Jean-Gabriel Pageau got the call, and they rewarded their coachês promise by continually forcing turnovers and shooting at the empty net until finally Pageauês shot went in. The Sens would then keep the Canucks out of the zone for the final couple minutes to preserve Andyês shutout. Sens Hero: Ryan Dzingel Two goals. What more can you say? Sens Hero: Craig Anderson Great game by a goalie who desperately needed one. The Sens didnêt need his absolute best tonight, but he gave it to them anyway. Honourable Mention: Bobby Ryan Seriously, check out that backhand dish: Worth a comment: Line juggling Boucher took a bit of an unorthodox approach to his lines tonight, essentially spreading scoring across three lines and then having an obvious fourth line. It mostly worked, with both Dzingel-Brassard-Ryan and Smith-Pageau-Stone having solid games. Hoffman-Turris-Pyatt probably didnêt go as well as heêd hoped, but overall this game ended up being a success. Game Oddity: Penalties Each team took a penalty in the first. Then there were no more. I donêt remember the last time I saw such a low-penalty game (outside of playoff Game 7s) Special shoutout: The guy wearing a Mike Peluso jersey while celebrating the win  ",Nucks Misconduct,Troy Stecher? Troy Stecher!,"Coming home after losing back to back games AND a few players to the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks, the Canucks must have been looking forward to the next three games at home where theyêve been 4-0 to start the season. With Chris Tanev being one of the teams losses in the California Crunch (patent pending), fans were back on the Troy Stecher bandwagon after hearing he was called up from the Utica Comets along with Right Winger Jayson Megna. While Megna was shuffled between the third and fourth lines, Troy Stecher had the second highest time on ice for Canucks (22:35) on the top pairing with preseason line mate Alex Edler (22:37). He looked confident in his first NHL game, made some great passing plays in both ends of the ice and didnêt hesitate to lead a few rushes in the offensive zone.  Itês interesting to see how young our blueline has become. Our top 4 of Troy Stecher (22), Ben Hutton (23), Erik Gudbranson (24) , only has one player over 25 (Alex Edler, 30). I still canêt wrap my head around the fact that Erik Gudbranson is only a year older than Ben Hutton. With all the hype going into this game, the Vancouver Canucks couldnêt rise to the occasion. The recent line juggling of Guy Boucher and the Ottawa Senators paid dividends and Ryan Dzingel seems to be securing his spot on the second line with Derrick Brassard and Bobby Ryan after a two goal night. For the first time this season, the Vancouver Canucks were shut out by the Ottawa Senators in a 3-0 loss (their first at home this season). First Period The Vancouver Canucks Canucks are still struggling to find a way to score in the first period. The only goal scored in the opening frame was from Bo Horvatês goal against the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday. Luca Sbisa took a number of steps backward today after surprisingly solid start to the season. Channeling the Sbisa weêve known and _lovedÓ in the past, he made a number of questionable plays in the defensive end and served up a couple deep dish pizzas to a team desperate for a turnaround on offence. The Ottawa Senators seized their opportunity when the Canucks made a bad line change, and attacked with an odd man rush on the open side of the ice. Ryan Dzingel put Ottawa on the board with a goal off the rebound after Derrick Brassard got a shot past Alex Edler. We were also treated to this dazzling display of speed and skill from future captain Bo Horvat. Troy Stecher ended the period with 7:58 in ice time. He showed off his offensive capabilities and looked very comfortable in his debut. Second Period The Vancouver Canucks came out swinging in the middle frame. Both the first and second lines got a lot of good chances on net and were keeping the Senators on their heels. However, Loui Eriksson still seems to be struggling to find chemistry with the team. He still seems to have issues knowing where his line mates will be and had trouble passing the puck at times. Iêm still hopeful that heês simply adapting to a new system after the World Cup limited his training camp and pre-season on a new team. Vancouver worked hard in the middle period to stay in the game but still couldnêt find a way to get the puck past Craig Anderson.  But all was not lost! Troy Stecher gave fans something to talk about after ending the second period leading his team in ice time.  Third Period Ryan Miller seemed looked to start the third period on a strong footing after a nice save against a wide open Mike Hoffman to start the period. However, only a few minutes later Ryan Dzingel grabbed his second goal of the night (4th this season) after Luca Sbisa decided to turn his back on the guy he was supposed to be covering. Troy Stecher played very well in the third period, making a lot of nice passes and joining the rush with ease. At one point, he decided to simply BE the rush. The Canucks really turned up the intensity near the end of the game and had couple of solid scoring chances to show for it. The only problem was they still couldnêt to find the back of the net. Hoping to generate a chance, Willie Desjardins pulled Ryan Miller with two minute left. While Vancouver had a few chances with the extra man, they never had a chance to set up a prolonged attack once Jean-Gabriel Pageau potted the empty netter to secure the 3-0 lead. Despite the loss, Troy Stecher brought a new level of energy to our blueline and plenty of hope for the future. Here he is speaking with the media following his NHL debut.  "

His patience paid off Friday night. Hamilton scored his first two goals of the season and added an assist to lead the Flames to a 5-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators for their third straight win. ""For me, I have to get pucks on net. Sometimes they go in, sometimes they don't, you just have to keep shooting,"" said Hamilton, who entered the game with 22 shots, second on the team. Hamilton broke a 2-2 tie halfway through the second when, from the sideboards, he spun and whipped a shot from a bad angle over Chris Driedger's shoulder. It was the second goal on five shots to beat the rookie goaltender, who entered the game with a 2-1 lead. He took over to begin the second after Andrew Hammond left with a lower-body injury. ""There was definitely a little bit of nerves early,"" said Driedger, who finished with just 11 stops on 15 shots in his third NHL appearance. ""A tough game to stay into with not a lot of shots, but there's no excuses. "" Sam Bennett, Sean Monahan and Michael Frolik also scored for Calgary. Johnny Gaudreau and former Senator Alex Chiasson each had two assists. Brian Elliott stopped 31 shots and has started each game during the Flames' winning streak. ""He's a veteran guy and he knows how to manage the ebbs and flow,"" Calgary coach Glen Gulutzan said. ""He's a worker, he's a grinder, and he stays with it and he got rewarded tonight. After those two bounces, he played really good for us. "" After a rocky first three starts in a Flames uniform in which he gave up 14 goals on 87 shots, Elliott has been much sharper his last three starts while yielding just five goals on 88 shots. ""At the start of the year we didn't really know what kind of team we were and how to play effectively,"" Elliott said. ""Now guys are really buying into what we need to do. "" Erik Karlsson and Kyle Turris scored for Ottawa. ""(Driedger) gave us a chance. They just scored on the chances that they had,"" Karlsson said. ""They scored from the corner, they hit the boards and it bounced. That's the way it's going to be sometimes. "" Bennett tied the game 2-2 just 1:25 into the second on a setup from Chiasson. He has goals in three consecutive games and has six points during a four-game point streak. The story of the first period was Ottawa's 30th-ranked power play, which looked anything like that. Trailing 1-0, the Senators needed just 4 seconds on their first man-advantage for Karlsson to tie the game. Two minutes later, Ottawa went back to the extra man and converted again, with Turris' shot eluding Elliott, who was screened by Zack Smith. NOTES: Senators starting goalie Craig Anderson, coming off a shutout in Vancouver on Tuesday, was granted a leave from the team to attend to a personal matter. ... Driedger, who played three seasons of junior hockey for the Calgary Hitmen (WHL), appeared in his third NHL game - all in relief. ... Calgary first-round pick Matthew Tkachuk played in his seventh game, creeping closer to the point where the Flames need to make a decision on whether to send him back to London of the OHL. If he plays in a 10th game, the first year of his entry-level contract will kick-in. UP NEXT Senators: At Edmonton on Sunday night before returning home for three games in five days. Flames: Host Washington on Sunday night before heading out on a four-game trip.  ",B T,"Sens Lose the Game, Hammond","The game started with a great pace for both teams. It was over four straight minutes of solid back and forth rush hockey before the first whistle. For all the tearing up and down the ice though, neither team was getting much to the net. Dangerous plays off the rush kept getting broken up by the respective D before shots could get off. One of the few times early on that either team was able to set up anything resembling a cycle, Johnny Gaudreau fed a pass to the point where Dougie Hamilton slapped a blazing one-timer past Andrew Hammond to put the Flames on the board. The pace continued, again with a whole lot of skating and not a whole lot of rubber making it to the goalies. Things got interesting when Matt Tkachuk got the puck just outside of the Ottawa zone, managed to get around Erik Karlsson and was almost free and clear on the break when... he held Karlssonês stick. Iêve seen plenty of offensive zone penalties, and Iêve seen plenty of penalties that kill your own teamês play in progress, but Iêve never seen a player take a penalty to ruin their own breakaway before. If taking the most ill-advised minor Iêve ever seen wasnêt enough, Tkachuk wasnêt given much time to reflect on it. Only four seconds in to the power play, Karlsson wired home a shot from pretty much dead middle on the blue line to tie the game at 1. Sometimes the obvious PP strategy of _feed KarlssonÓ works. Didnêt take too long for the Flames to head to the box again, this time on a tripping call. The Sens werenêt able to get a whole lot going - they largely held the puck, but couldnêt make much of it. As Karlsson had shown it doesnêt always take much on the power play though, and the first puck that found itês way to Brian Elliott found itês way past Brian Elliott to give the Sens the lead. The second period started with a bit of a surprise - it wasnêt Hammond in the net, but to everyoneês confusion it was Chris Driedger. Always the reliever and never the starter. It turns out that Hammond had suffered an injury in the dying moments of the first. The Sens were looking pretty good at first - they still had almost a minute and a half of penalty to kill, and were getting more chances than Calgary was. But, as weêve learned, it doesnêt take much. Alex Chiasson fed the puck out into the low slot, and Sam Bennett buried it into a nearly open net. Driedgerês first NHL goal allowed wasnêt a great one. It did come just as the penalty expired, so the penalty kill technically did their job as far as the record keepers are concerned. There was an interesting moment on a Senators power play - Derrick Brassard got tangled up with Elliott and both went down. Before getting completely untangled and upright, Brassard ducked and covered his head almost going into the foetal position just a moment before Karlsson rang a slap shot off the post just over top of him. Brassard wasnêt even looking that way, so it sure looks like Elliott warned him what was coming. The penalty kill had another chance to test their game when Chris Wideman went to the box for tripping Kris Versteeg. They killed off the full two minutes, only allowing a single (blocked) shot attempt the entire time - then before Wideman could make it back into the play Dougie Hamilton snuck a wide angle shot past Driedger to give the Flames their second lead of the game. The third period was similar to the first, with a lot of back and forth but without much really dangerous pressure. More of the time was spent in the Calgary zone, but Ottawa couldnêt create much from the zone time. The Flames took a 4-2 lead on a play where Gaudreau got Driedger moving back and forth from behind the net before getting the puck out to Sean Monahan who fired it past Chiassonês screen. Shortly after, when Ceci tried to pinch the play at the Sens blue line - he got his man, but Mikael Backlund scooped up the puck to create a two on one. Phaneuf got a little bit of the pass to Michael Frolik, but not enough. 5-2 Flames. The Sens would get a little going right towards the end, but that goal mostly took the wind out of their sails. Honourable Mention: Penalty Kill Despite two of the goals coming juuuuuust after the kill ended, the PK largely kept Calgary from getting anything going. And those two goals were ones that Driedger probably wants back. Honourable Mention: Mark Borowiecki Quietly did his job tonight. Played over 15 minutes, was barely noticeable, and wasnêt on for any of the goals against. Zero: Chris Driedger So much for that 1.00 career SV%, right? Driedger let in four goals on just 15 shots, and the first two were especially rough. He needs to be better if Hammond is going to miss any more time. Killer: Dougie Hamilton Opened the scoring, assisted on the tying goal, and scored the game winner. Pascal LeClaire Memorial Award: Andrew Hammond Seriously? This is going to be our goaltending luck this season? Hoffman Watch 5 shot attempts tonight, the most dangerous ones being blocked. Have to figure heês going to put up a G sooner or later...  ",Matchsticks and Gasoline,"Flames Capitalize on Senators Awful Goaltending, Win 5-2"," The Flames downed the Senators by a final of 5-2. Here's what happened. Period One The senators started the game with a faceoff win, but they didn't exactly follow the dump with a chase as the Flames took control. They got the puck into the zone and after a little bit of control Dennis Wideman fired off the first shot about a minute into the game. They looked pretty sharp until Jyrki Jokipakka wound up turning the puck over for a two on one, but nothing really materialized for the Senators. The puck looked a bit lively; some seemingly abnormal bounces made it difficult for either team to establish momentum. The first whistle came with 15:42 remaining when the Flames went offside. Ottawa got the puck deep into the Calgary zone, but didn't seem all too fond of actually going after the puck. The Flames got the puck back and advanced it back into Ottawa's zone way too easily. This horrible play from Ottawa set up the first goal of the game. Ottawa tried to clear the puck out of their zone once the Flames had established momentum, but Jokipakka managed to keep it in. He got the puck over to Johnny Gaudreau who fed the puck back to Dougie Hamilton and he hammered it home from there. It was a decent shot and there was a slight screen by Sean Monahan, but given the range and the angle that's one that Andrew Hammond had to stop. The time of the goal was 5:24. Play was back and forth for the next five minutes or so with very few stoppages. The Flames carried the lead into the ten minute mark and it was warranted. They lead in shots four to three at the post-ten minute stoppage, but things shifted in the Senators favour quickly from there. Right out of the commercial break it looked like Matthew Tkachuk had himself a breakaway as he stole the puck away from Erik Karlsson. If it looked way too easy, it was because he was also trying to steal karlsson 's stick away in the process. He received a holding the stick penalty, the Flames went onto the penalty kill, and Ottawa quickly capitalized. Derick Brassard won the faceoff and Mike Hoffman took control of the puck. They got it to their most dangerous player in Karlsson and he took it from there. It would have been a difficult save for Elliott, but it's one he possibly could have had. It took them only four seconds to score on the power play as the Flames special teams woes continue. The time of the goal was 11:36. Shortly there after Sam Bennett took yet another offensive zone penalty as he was called for tripping.  Michael Frolik mmade a foot save on the ensuing penalty kill and was in a noticeable amount of agony. The Flames managed to clear the puck off of the glass to force a stoppage, but there was still time left in the penalty kill. Ottawa scored on the ensuing faceoff.  Kyle Turris took control of the puck at the left point and fired it off.  Mark Stone had a fantastic screen on Brian Elliott as the puck beat the Calgary netminder blocker side for the goal.  Dion Phaneuf picked up the primary assist (his first assist of the season) while Ryan Dzingel picked up the secondary 14:51 into the period. The Flames looked utterly abhorrent on both penalty kills. The Flames lost a step after the penalty kill as the Senators carried the play. Perhaps Ottawa was starting to find their rhythm, but the Flames didn't do anything to encumber that. Their play fell off and the looks on the bench were those of noticeable dejection. That four to three shot difference that had favoured the Flames was now a ten to four advantage for Ottawa with about a minute and a half left in the period. The Flames finally found a bit of momentum from there as the Monahan line and Brodie pairing had the Senators on the ropes. Zack Smith committed the cross check and Calgary went on to maintain possession of the puck up until the 19:24 mark of the period. Gaudreau tried to do a bit too much as he skated above the slot and fired off an ugly looking backhander that Ottawa took control of. It would have been nice to see him a bit more composed to either get off a good shot or milk it as much as possible to ensure they'd get the most time possible on fresh ice to start the second. Calgary started the man advantage with 36 seconds left in the first. They didn't manage any shots in that time period. Time expired with Ottawa up on top by a score of two to one, both goals coming off of the man advantage. Calgary finished with four shots on goal for the period - that's not going to win many games. Period Two Hammond was injured at some point in the first period and Chris Driedger lead the Senators onto the ice after only two games in the AHL and the Flames were on the power play to boot. The Flames capitalized off of a nice, gritty goal by Bennett.  Alex Chiasson made a fantastic backhand pass from behind the goal line and Bennett forced it through. Dougie Hamilton picked up the secondary assist a minute and 25 seconds into the period. Note that the goal was scored just after the power play expired so that percentage drops a bit more. The official injury report on Hammond was that he had a lower body injury. He was ruled out for the game leaving the Senators with Driedger as their only healthy goalie.  Craig Anderson is on bereavement for a personal issue leaving the Flames emergency goalie as the backup. About four minutes into the period the Flames had the puck in the offensive zone and got it back to Kris Versteeg, but his stick had broken. He attempted to steal Cody Ceci's stick which possibly prevented a breakaway, but he was called on it and went off for the Flames' second holding the stick penalty. It was hardly a brilliant play by anybody involved on the Flames. The Flames didn't look too terrible on this penalty kill. Brassard slid into Elliott like a baserunner into second base, but strangely enough it wasn't called. Ottawa didn't manage to score anyway as Elliot froze the puck. The third time was the charm for Calgary as they finally killed off a penalty, but Ottawa was clearly carrying the play up to this point as they lead in shots 20 to eight into the first commercial break of the period. Chris Wideman tripped up Versteeg eight minutes into the period as Versteeg had the puck in the right corner of the Senators zone. Gaudreau came on and made some fantastic moves with the Calgary net empty. After some nifty play between Gaudreau and T.J. Brodie, the puck found Sean Monahan who fanned on the shot completely and the Senators took control. The ensuing power play saw some nice defensive play by Ottawa, but also some sloppy power play from the Flames. They didn't have much going, but did manage to keep the puck in as time expired. The Flames bombarded the noticeably flummoxed Driedger who had zero rebound control. The puck hit the post and Hamilton was once again there to pick up the rebound and fire it home.  Micheal Ferland and Brodie picked up the assists on what was technically an even strength goal at 5:24 of the period. The Flames were very fortunate to be leading at this point. Heading into the second commercial break of the period, the Flames were being outshot 22 to ten, but held a three to two lead thanks to some horrid goaltending from Ottawa. Ottawa once again received power play thanks to a holding penalty by Bennett. Elliott was the savior on the ensuing penalty kill. Ottawa had three shots on goal in two minutes as the Flames struggled to gain any type of control. They managed to kill of the penalty kill and head off to another commercial break and a chance to potentially gain some composure. Shots were 15 to six for the period at this point. The Flames had a few chances in the waning minutes of the second including one that glanced of some bodies in front before bouncing off of the post, but Driedger swept it away before anybody could capitalize. At the end of period shots were 26 to 12 in favour of the Senators, but the Flames found themselves in the welcome position of having a noticeable advantage in net. They took a very fortunate three to two lead into the third period. Period Three Ottawa continued to carry the play through the early part of the third period, but the pace slowed considerably. Ottawa had three shots on goal in the first five minutes to Calgary's zero. Their best opportunity came after about seven minutes had passed in the period when Troy Brouwer deflected a Jokipakka shot, but Driedger made a nice save. The Flames were playing some absolutely horrid and boring hockey, but they were already up by a goal when they really turned on the jets. Chiasson made some nice moves to get the puck behind the net to Gaudreau. Gaudreau passed the puck to a Monahan who was set up in the slot for the one-timer. He let off a beautifully placed shot which beat Driedger blocker side to give the Flames a four to two lead nine minutes and 33 seconds into the third period. Ottawa got the puck into the Flames zone, but the Flames regained control as Phaneuf and Deryk Engelland went at it. Phaneuf picked up the delayed penalty, but the Flames never had a chance to go on the power play. Tkachuk passed the puck over to Mikael Backlund and he and Frolik were off to the races. Backlund sent it over to Frolik who snapped it past an obviously outclassed Driedger with relative ease with 7:41 left in the game. The Senators didn't have much fight left in them at this point and the Flames started to control play as the crowd facetiously chanted for Phaneuf. With 3:39 left in the period, shots were 31 to 19. It can't be understated how outstanding Elliott looked up to this point save for maybe one goal. All five goals for Calgary came at even strength. Elliott made few good saves in garbage time as the Flames coasted to victory. The final in Calgary - the Flames three, the Senators one. This one wasn't necessarily a moral victory as they were completely outclassed for the first two periods but faced an inferior goalie, but that third period was something to build on. They finished with a 48.3 percent score adjusted five-on-five Corsi - nothing to write home about, but considerably better than their season average. Bring on Washington! "

The public address announcer said his name, and he lumbered onto the ice, tears flowing during an ovation from the other team's fans. Anderson made his first start since learning of his wife's cancer diagnosis and had 37 saves for his second shutout in two starts, helping Ottawa beat the Edmonton Oilers 2-0 on Sunday night. Anderson left the team Thursday to be with his wife, Nicholle, but returned to start this game. Teammates took turns hugging Anderson after the final horn, and then Anderson was left to wait alone in the hallway after being named the game's first star. The Edmonton crowd gave him a rousing cheer when he emerged, and among those clapping was Oilers goalie Cam Talbot, who had been named the No. 2 star. It was anderson 's 35th career shutout, and he hasn't allowed a goal in 121:54. ""We couldn't really feel the gravity until the final whistle,"" Ottawa captain Erik Karlsson said. ""We accomplished a great game, led by Andy. He held a strong face, but you could still see the pain in his eyes. And he came in here and led by example. He didn't say much, had the same routine, and showed what a true leader he is. "" Anderson was not available for comment after the game. ""(Anderson) being able to play the way he did under those circumstances, you have to give him so much credit. It's an unthinkable situation,"" Talbot said. ""I can't even imagine what was going through his mind. I don't know if I would be able to do what he just did. "" Mike Hoffman and Bobby Ryan scored for the Senators, who have won two of three. The Oilers ended a five-game winning streak. Edmonton is 7-2-0, its best start to the season since going 8-1-0 in 1985-86. ""We're going to lose some games in an 82-game season,"" captain Connor McDavid said. ""You can't expect to win each and every night. I thought we played well defensively and when we didn't (Talbot) was a rock back there. "" Edmonton had a great chance seven minutes into the second period, but Anderson made a big kick save on rookie Jesse Puljujarvi. Ottawa scored 12:18 into the middle frame when Tom Pyatt was rewarded for some hard work, sending a backhand pass from behind the net in front to Hoffman, who scored his first of the season. Hoffman hit a post with a power-play blast later in the period. Anderson made another huge save midway through the third, stopping Jordan Eberle from point-blank range. Anderson is in his 14th NHL season and seventh with the Senators. He also shut out Vancouver in his last start on Oct. 25. ""Pretty emotional night with everything that's been going on with this group,"" Hoffman said, adding that Anderson is""a huge part of this team"" and""we're a family. "" Ottawa put the game away with an empty-netter from Ryan with 32 seconds remaining. Talbot had 20 saves. NOTES: This was the first of two meetings this season between the teams. The other is Jan. 8th in Ottawa. ... Anderson started Sunday because Andrew Hammond got a lower-body injury on Friday in Calgary. UP NEXT Senators: Head home to face Carolina on Tuesday. Oilers: Begin a five-game trip in Toronto on Tuesday.   ",Ross A,Craig Anderson earns emotional shutout over Oilers,"It was the kind of thing movies are made about. After shutting out the Canucks, Craig Anderson took a personal leave of absence from the team. As it turns out, Nicholle, his wife, had been diagnosed with cancer. But when backup Andrew Hammond went down against the Flames, Nicholle reportedly told Andy that his team needed him. And he earned a huge win, stopping all 37 shots against the red hot Oilers en route to his second shutout of the week. It was emotional to say the least, as a quick Twitter search of gifs will show you. Also, apologies if there are loads of typos here. I'm typing on my phone as a passenger on the trip back to Calgary after the game. The first period opened poorly for Sens fans. Connor McDavid had an electrifying first shift, deking through the Sens defence. It made the building even louder. The Oilers would get the only three powerplays of the period, but they couldn't solve Andy with some quick passing. The second period saw Ottawa tie up the shots early, only to watch the game slip out of their hands a bit later. But importantly, Ottawa scored the only goal. Mike Hoffman got his long-awaited first of the season after a nice behind-the-net pass from Çbona fide NHLerê Tom Pyatt. That seemed to ignite something in Hoff, who gained confidence, making smart dekes and even hitting a post on the powerplay. The third period saw Ottawa play alright to start it, but the Oilers took over pushing for that tying goal. Ottawa went into a shell for the final six minutes, but Andy continued to stop everything, and Bobby Ryan sealed the win with an empty-netter because he was on the ice to protect a one-goal lead for some reason. Sens won, 2-0. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson No one else deserves a hero nod tonight. Even in the third period I saw him bobble a puck, and realized it was the first time I'd seen him do that all game. He was stellar. All the best to Nicholle and Craig as they continue to navigate what must be s a difficult time. Honourable Mention: Mike Hoffman He looked like a man on a mission in the second. Here's hoping that goal opens the floodgates for arguably Ottawaês best goal scorer.  ",The Copper and Blue,Oilers 0 - Senators 2 -- So This is What Losing Feels Like,"Before the start of this game, I arrogantly told my friend that I don't remember what it feels like to lose anymore. I remember now. It feels terrible. Sometimes, games are really unfair. On a night the Oilers actually outshot the opponents 37-22, the end result was still a 0-2 loss to the Ottawa Senators, snapping a precarious five-game winning streak that had the fanbase feeling simultaneously elated and uneasy. This loss shouldn't hurt as much because the Oilers were definitely the better team tonight, who happened to run into an outstanding goaltending performance by Craig Anderson, but it somehow hurts more than those losses last season. Maybe it's because I'm not numb to losses like before. Maybe it's because for the first time, we actually have something to lose, a great record and winning streak on the line. This game felt like being stuck in traffic and ending up late for an important appointment when you made sure to leave  early. It felt like studying really hard for an exam, only for the professor to test you on something never mentioned in class. It was a stifling, suffocating loss, the kind throughout which I screamed out loud to no one in particular,  JUST ONE GOAL, PLEASE.  Ultimately, though, if the winning streak had to snap at some point, this was probably the best way to do so-- in a way that the Oilers actually outplayed their opponent in most aspects, in a way that proved the past few wins were not merely a fluke, in a way that resulted in an incredible shutout for Craig Anderson in his first game back since a leave of absence to be with his wife, who had just been diagnosed with cancer. He was named the first star of the game and this moment will definitely make your eyes very sweaty. This loss is fortunately different from the one to Buffalo-- here's hoping the team continues the good parts from this game, polishes up the rough spots, and regroups for a good practice tomorrow before the Matthews vs. McDavid matchup in Toronto on Tuesday. First Period The first period was significant because it was insignificant despite a plethora of opportunities to make it otherwise. Gifted with three powerplay opportunities, one late in the period off a really pretty move by Connor McDavid that made Brassard look rather pathetic, the Oilers failed to convert on any of their chances. A combination of errant passes and indecisive zone entries made it difficult to generate any sustained pressure, and the Oilers failed to capitalize on an opportunity to take an early lead in what would turn out to be a very close, low-scoring game. I hope Jay Woodcroft goes back to the drawing board, destroys it, and creates something actually legitimate because the failure to capitalize on any of the powerplays this game was a big reason the Oilers lost tonight. A beautiful move by McDavid in the opening minutes would prove to be a rare spark in a period that was overall stifling for both teams-- the Sens still had yet to post a shot ten minutes into the game, and the somewhat lethargic period finished 7-4 in favour of the Oilers in shots . Talbot continued to be solid, with a beautiful glove save 11 minutes in to keep the game scoreless, and Patrick Maroon showed the world his body is in fact composed of titanium when he remained on the ice after taking a painful-looking Oscar Klefbom shot off the inside of his foot during the Oilers' third powerplay. Second Period For all those uneasy about the precarious five-game win streak on the line, the second period likely did nothing to quell those qualms. This period was so unsatisfying to watch and I accumulated a massive amount of internal rage-- the puck stubbornly refused to go into the Senators net, and despite a number of good chances, Craig Anderson was there to make a number of great stops on the pressuring Oilers, including a great one on Jordan Eberle off a nifty McDavid cross-ice pass, and then freezing Milan Lucic on the same shift. The Senators clearly got a good talking to during the first intermission, as they came out blazing in the first five minutes, outshooting the Oilers 4-1. The Oilers, roused from their brief nap, picked up the pace significantly after that, shifting the speed of the game with some great end-to-end action and coming back to outshoot the Senators 16-10 at the nine minute mark. It only takes one bad shift for everything to unravel, though, and a turnover by Larsson coming out of the zone led to the first goal of the game, as Mike  Rocket Richard  Hoffman scored at 12:18 into the second to give the Sens a 1-0 lead. Hoffman continued to get shot after shot on net after that first goal, as the mere mention of his name was enough to give me unpleasant sensations, but luckily Talbot bailed his team out repeatedly to keep the game at a one-goal deficit when it could have easily been much worse. Of note was how little Connor McDavid factored into this period, as the Senators manhandled my son repeatedly and kept him from being the dynamic force we're used to seeing him be. I use the word manhandled because there were a few instances when a penalty probably could have been called, like when Erik Karlsson had his hands all over him along the boards and nearly mangled him towards the end of the period, but the poor kid continued to take abuse throughout the rest of the game without any calls from the referees. I cry for my son. Third Period I want to believe. I turned my optimism dial all the way up, even beyond Oilers level, but seeing how Anderson was playing on a higher level, a little part of me had a feeling there would be no goals scored by the Oilers tonight. And they certainly fought hard-- this period was absolutely dominated by the Oilers, outshooting the Senators 18-7, but rush after rush, shot after shot, Anderson was there to suck up the puck like a black hole, with nary a rebound given up. McLellan did his best to spark the team, juggling the lines and replacing Lucic with Draisaitl on the line with McDavid and Eberle, but the zero would not budge. The Senators continued to tie up Connor McDavid successfully, despite a couple of good shifts from the top line this period, and time ticked away as the we saw hope slowly evaporate, the final blow coming as Bobby Ryan put away the empty net goal with 33 seconds left in the game. Ugh. The Good Despite the loss, it was awesome to see Craig Anderson have an amazing game. Best wishes to him and his wife Nicholle on their fight with cancer-- the whole hockey community is with you.  It's easy to overlook, but this game featured another solid performance from Cam Talbot, who has only given up three goals in his last five games. There were a number of heartstopping moments after the Senators took a 1-0 lead, but Talbot was consistently and stable the entire night to keep his team in the game.  Kris Russell continues his steady play with a number of steady little plays-- in particular, he exhibits great poise with the puck under pressure, making the necessary plays with patience to ensure there are no hasty passes or risky zone exits.  Patrick Maroon was noticeable on the ice all night long, making a couple of great passes and a number of solid hits to add a much-needed physical presence to the game. It's lovely to see #19 come in with a smirk on his face when a teammate gets hit hard-- he finished the game with 5 hits, a team-high 76.19 CF% (despite a 14.29 Zone Start%), and two shots on goal.  The penalty kill is still stellar- now third in the league at 89.7%, the penalty killers, in particular Mark Letestu, did a great job at dismantling plays, with Sekera even carrying the puck the other way a few times and setting up for a brief cycle and shot in the third period.  Ryan Nugent-Hopkins has yet to register a goal this season, but he continues to do many things right, finishing with a team-high five shots on goal tonight and was a sparkling 69% in the faceoff circle, continuing his great work there of late. Nugey is due. The Bad The Ottawa Senators were all over Connor McDavid tonight, particularly towards the latter half of the game. He still generated a number of opportunities and drew a penalty, but was held off the scoresheet with just two shots. As great as McDavid is, he will continue to be targeted night after night, and needs to find a way to consistently fight this off and turn on Jet Pack Connor as he did earlier in the season.  Jordan Eberle looked really lost tonight-- he made a really bad puck clearing attempt early in the third period, and as the game got more intense, Eberle seemed to play more half-heartedly, continually missing passes and failing to get the puck out of his own zone cleanly. *goes and finds World Junior Youtube videos of Eberle to rekindle my positive feelings towards him*  I started twitching nervously whenever Eric Gryba had the puck on his stick in the third period. His lack of speed is being exposed more often, with Talbot even coming out of his net to play a puck he knew Gryba was not going to catch up to before the Sens player. My eyes were shooting lasers at him as plays seemed to repeatedly die on his stick in the third, with small defensive lapses here and there becoming increasingly the norm.  The Ugly The powerplay was extremely lame, going 0/4 tonight on a night it would have made a monumental difference. I don't even get excited when we go on the powerplay anymore-- the third powerplay in the first period began with a rush by the Sens going the other way.  Game in a Haiku Yup, losing still sucks. I have not forgotten you, Darkness, my old friend.  "
9,1 Regular,11/1/2016,7:30 PM,,Carolina Hurricanes,2,1,W,OT,6,3,0,W 2,32,13,0,2,0,33,11,0,3,0,"13,049",2:40,Turris scores in OT to lift Senators over Canes 2-1,"The Ottawa Senators could overlook their sloppy start thanks to a strong finish. Kyle Turris scored in overtime, lifting the Senators over the Carolina Hurricanes 2-1 on Tuesday night. Dion Phaneuf also scored for the Senators, who were playing their first of ten home games this month. Craig Anderson made 32 saves. Jaccob Slavin scored the lone goal for the Hurricanes, and Cam Ward stopped 30 shots. Ottawa was coming off a nine-day, three-game trip that culminated with an emotional 2-0 win in Edmonton on Sunday night after learning anderson 's wife, Nicholle, had been diagnosed with cancer.  It's beyond words the way that he's playing right now with the circumstances and what he's going through with his wife,  Phaneuf said.  It's incredible. He's an inspiration to all of us, I will tell you that. He's just incredible to be doing what he's doing for our team right now with what he's going through.  To no surprise, the Senators lacked energy and had a slow start but managed to regroup and Ê thanks to Anderson Ê hung in despite some sloppy stretches. Ottawa coach Guy Boucher expected a slow start after the lengthy road trip and the emotional time his team went through supporting the Andersons, but was pleased with how his team responded after the first period.  I was so impressed with how the players battled to get that emotion back and they did it in every possible way,  Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said.  I thought we really played good in the second, third and the overtime and I believe we deserved it at that point.  Tied 1-1 to start the third, both teams had a couple of good chances, but Ward and Anderson could see most of the shots and made the stops.  I liked the effort, I liked the execution,  Hurricanes coach Bill Peters said.  I thought both teams made a push at certain times. Penalty kill was good, could have executed a little better at some offensive situations, but I liked the effort (Tuesday). The Senators struggled mightily in the first period, but thankfully Anderson was solid when the Hurricanes outshot Ottawa 16-5 and controlled much of the action. Carolina scored on its first shot after some poor defensive coverage from the Senators allowed Slavin easy entry from center ice. Ottawa tied it at the 13-minute mark of the first when phaneuf 's shot from the point beat Ward low glove side. The Senators were without Mark Stone for the third period as the winger suffered an upper body injury. Carolina's Victor Rask ended his eight-game point streak (four goals, six assists), and Jeff Skinner's five-game point streak (four goals, five assists) also ended. NOTES: D Thomas Chabot and G Matt O'Connor were a healthy scratch for the Senators. Carolina's Ryan Murphy played his first game after suffering a lower body injury in early October that kept him out of the lineup. UP NEXT Hurricanes: Play at Nashville Predators on Saturday night. Senators: Host the Canucks on Thursday night.  ",Ross A,Anderson outduels Ward in 2-1 win,"Apparently low-scoring, high-saving is the new normal for games featuring Craig Anderson. He finished with 31 saves in a 2-1 overtime victory over the Carolina Hurricanes, a save total matched by Cam Ward. The game didnêt start off well for Senators fans. A giveaway off the opening faceoff gave defenceman Jaccob Slavin the chance to skate in and fire a backhander bar-down for a lead just 30 seconds into the game. After back-to-back shutouts, it seemed Andy was heading back to his season-opening form. But he held the fort, and he needed to, as the Sens were outshot 14-1 to start the period. But Ottawa would claw back a couple scoring chances, and would score on a bullet from Dion Phaneuf that showed that he can still shoot the puck at an elite level. Other than the 16-5 shot line, the first period was also notable for 5:43 of it being played 4-on-4 thanks to two sets of offsetting minors, and a Derick Brassard penalty early into a Sens powerplay. The second period would see the dominant team switch, as the Sens pounded 15 on net compared to the Canesê 6. It was all for naught though, as Ward had found his Conn Smythe form, and turned everything aside. It set up a tense third period. To my eyes, the Sens had the better run of play in the third period, but it was pretty even. Both teams had decent chances to take the lead, and both goalies stood tall. It really looked like it was going to come down to which team could produce a bit of magic. And neither team could in regulation. Overtime again seemed to be tipped slightly in the Sensê favour for me. Ottawa seemed to dictate most of the flow, and eventually they were rewarded with Kyle Turris streaking into the zone and firing a beautiful wrister to the corner through the screen of a defenceman. It was a goal weêve seen him score so many times in the past, and it sealed the 2-1 victory for the Sens. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson He stopped 32 shots in a row for the W. After a shaky start to the season, heês really settled in. Honourable Mention: Derick Brassard Other than the slashing penalty, he was having a great game, setting up plays, driving offence. He stood out to me. Honourable Mention: Erik Karlsson I donêt know how many times I saw him backcheck and break up the play with a quick takeaway and/or stick lift. The Fox Sports commentators seemed so surprised by his defensive play. Glimmer of Hope: Cody Ceci To my eyes, Ceci seemed decent in this game. He was solid past centre (as he often is), but he also seemed a little more certain in his own zone. This team really needs Ceci to improve to have any kind of hope, and Iêll take whatever small victories I can get. Sens Zero: Giveaways Officially, the teams tied in giveaways, 14-14. However, I felt like Ottawaês were much more costly, and led to the team generating nothing in the first period. You can only give up the puck unforced in the neutral zone so many times before you get burned. Thankfully the burn didnêt come this game. Sens Killer: Cam Ward Ottawa has a habit of ending poor stretches of play for opposing goalies (Brian Elliott, anyone?). Ward fell into this category, but thankfully Ottawaês goalie stood just as tall.  ",Canes Country,Overtime Woes Cost Hurricanes Again,"The Carolina Hurricanes showed Tuesday night that they still do not know how to win games in overtime. For the third time this season and 19th time since the beginning of last season, Caniacs endured the all too familiar fate of losing in the extra session. After a dominating first period, the Canes slowly faded the rest of the way. This was a very different game from others we have seen so far this season, but the outcome was frustratingly familiar. Talking Points Great start to the game The Canes came out firing in the first period, putting up 16 shots on goal and holding the Sens to just 5. The Canes were in a good position to score multiple goals during a first period spent largely in the Senatorsê end of the ice. After Jaccob Slavin netted his 3rd career goal early in the first, it seemed things were going well. Many times so far this season, the Canes have jumped out of the gate at full speed. With first-period leads in over half their games so far, the trend of establishing early leads is good to see. If the Canes ever figure out how to finish out games, their ability to score early will become a major asset.  The downside last night was the Canes failed to capitalize on their plethora of chances. Sebastian Aho has been on a mission to score his first career goal and had multiple chances during the first. Jeff Skinner also created many chances yet was unable to find the back of the net. Then, the Sens were able to get an easy shot past Cam Ward late in the first and the period ended tied. The Canes must find a way to finish their chances, even with such great starts.                                           Powerless Power Play The Hurricanesê power play is quickly coming back to down to earth after a hot start. The team went 0-3 last night and, more to the point, the unit looked bad. The Canes are just 2 for 14 (14.2%) on the power play over their last five games. Plain and simple, Jeff Skinner canêt do it all. Paging Jordan Staal, Elias Lindholm, and Teuvo Teravainen, the power play needs you! Ryan Murphy drew back in to the lineup last night and although he didnêt see any power play time against the Sens, it would be reasonable to expect him to be out there against the Predators on Saturday. Murphy may not have produced over the years, but he can still move the puck. And who knows, maybe this will be his long-awaited breakout year. The power play was hard to watch at times against Ottawa, continuing a trend from the last few games. The Canes need their power play unit to step up their game to start posting some wins on the board. Theyêve done it before; now they just need to find the mojo again, and preferably sooner rather than later.                                           Not Being Bullied  The physical game showed up throughout the first period and we even saw Phil Di Giuseppe drop the gloves. The physical aspect of Canes games has been missing for years. Fights are a rare occurrence and nobody seems to want to stand up for their teammates, even dating back to the Kirk Muller era. After PDGês scrum with Matt Puempel, the physicality continued throughout the game and Jordan Staal almost went at it with Dion Phaneuf (!) late in the first period. A more physical presence would certainly benefit the Canes, mentally if no other way, moving forward.  Every team in the league knows that Jeff Skinner is hot and that he is the Canesê best player. When teams target him physically, the Canes have to step up and protect their guy. Neither of the altercations that occurred last night directly dealt with Skinner, but it is only a matter of time before a situation arises where Skinner gets bullied. How the team responds will certainly set a tone that he is not to be trifled with.  The Hurricanes cannot expect Di Giuseppe, who isnêt the most intimidating player in hockey, to be their personal protection agency. It is time to see Andrej Nestrasil, Bryan Bickell and some of the defensemen step up their physicality.                                           Overtime Woes Continue Honestly, you could simply insert any of the numerous things already written about the Canes overtime issues here. It is becoming a very sad norm for the Hurricanes: play a good game, choke in overtime. After leading the league in OT losses last year, the Canes are well on their way to claiming that title again.  It is never good when fans expect to lose in overtime. It is no longer a matter of win or lose, just how long overtime runs before the Canes lose. So when Kyle Turris fired one past Cam Ward it was not a surprise, just a simple _we knew it was coming.Ó The team seems to lack confidence in overtime. Against the Sens, the Canes were sloppy in overtime and very loose with the puck. They managed to hang on for three-plus minutes before letting one in, but they only had one legitimate chance during overtime. Elias Lindholm got the partial break away and was hooked with no call (natch), but beyond that, the Sens held the puck the majority of the time and got the result they likely deserved.  Three-on-three hockey is very exciting and one of the best things the NHL has provided us with. But with that being said, it is the death of the Canes. We have seen the team try 2 forwards and 1 defenseman, then try 2 defensemen with one forward. Nothing works. Maybe they try 3 forwards going forward? Maybe they just go ahead and pull the goalie and try for the 4 on 3? Heck, maybe they just wave the white flag at the end of regulation and save everyone some trouble.  Something has to change with the Canesê overtime woes, or else their slim playoff chances take even more of a hit. It is sadly becoming familiar that the teamês play in overtime is a consistent storyline.                                           Moral of the Story The Hurricanes showed up to play and came out on fire, but they couldnêt make their chances count. Lackluster power plays and a general malaise for the final 58-plus minutes led to the game being tied at the end of regulation, then overtime was as predictable as the sun rising in the east. With a few days off, the coaching staff needs to focus on the power play and 3-on-3 performance. With a few days off, the schedule lines up nicely, and the Canes desperately need a reset that theyêll have the chance to achieve over the course of the next three days.  "
10,1 Regular,11/3/2016,7:30 PM,,Vancouver Canucks,1,0,W,,7,3,0,W 3,24,20,0,4,0,27,22,0,2,0,"13,260",2:34,Condon makes 27 saves as Ottawa beat Canucks 1-0,"Mike Condon showed his new coach he was prepared to debut with the Ottawa Senators despite the circumstances. Condon, who was acquired from Pittsburgh on Wednesday for a 2017 fifth-round draft pick, made 27 saves as the Senators blanked the Vancouver Canucks 1-0 on Thursday night. Upon learning of the trade, Condon flew from Los Angeles to arrive in Ottawa in the early hours Thursday morning and managed to grab a few hours of sleep before meeting with Senators goalie coach Pierre Groulx in preparation for his first game with the Senators. ""Came as advertised,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""I was expecting nervous, but our goalie coach said he'll be calm and that's exactly what he was. He was calm throughout the entire game. "" Condon made his first NHL start last year in Ottawa on Oct. 11, as a member of the Montreal Canadiens and posted a 3-1 victory. The Senators (7-3-0) couldn't say enough about condon 's performance considering the situation over the past 48 hours. ""Coming in yesterday and then playing today I'm guessing wasn't the easiest scenario for him, but he came in and played a heck of a game,"" said Mike Hoffman, who scored the game's only goal. ""He's a big reason we came out with two points. "" Jacob Markstrom made 23 saves for the Canucks (4-6-1), who have now lost seven straight (0-6-1) and have been shut out in four of their last five games. The Senators also shut out the Canucks 3-0 just over a week ago in Vancouver. ""It's disappointing,"" Canucks coach Willie Desjardins said. ""We played them better this time than we did at home. I thought we had a better effort, but at the same time we've got to find ways to score. "" Condon will likely get the nod in goal Saturday against Buffalo as Craig Anderson has taken an indefinite leave to be with his wife, Nicholle, who was diagnosed with cancer. Andrew Hammond remains sidelined with a groin injury and is expected to miss at least another week. Despite having played just one period of hockey this season, Condon looked solid by making a number of key saves throughout the game. The Senators helped Condon by blocking 25 shots, including five by Erik Karlsson. Condon made a number of stops in the third to keep the Canucks off the board, including two on Jannik Hansen and Sven Baertschi. ""I know they're a desperate team right now and we knew that coming in,"" Condon said. ""They like to throw pucks at the net from a lot of odd angles and that causes a little bit of chaos, but our defense did a good job boxing out in front of the net and not letting them get second opportunities so it was a good overall effort. "" The Senators relied on Condon early in the second as well as Vancouver dictated much of the play. Ottawa had just one shot on goal through the first 10 minutes of the period. ""We played a really good game and created enough chances for a couple (goals), but that's been the story so far this year,"" Vancouver's Henrik Sedinsaid. ""We realize it's only Game 11 and we have to keep working and doing the same things and know it's not a lack of chances. "" Ottawa made the most of a giveaway by Erik Gudbranson at the 14-minute mark of the second period as Markstrom tried to play the loose puck, but instead left a wide-open cage for Hoffman. This was the final meeting between the teams this season. Notes: Ottawa RW Mark Stone missed the game due to a neck injury, while D Chris Wideman was a late scratch due to an upper-body injury. LW Max McCormick and Fredrik Claesson were recalled from Binghamton and were in the lineup. ... Vancouver RW Jack Skille and D Alex Biega were healthy scratches. UP NEXT: Canucks: are at Toronto on Saturday. Senators: host Buffalo on Saturday.  ",Ary M,"Condon, Senators 100% successful in preventing any goals by the Canucks","Mike Condon put on his best Craig Anderson impression by stopping all 27 shots that came his way in his season debut with the Senators. No, itês not a 47-save shutout in your debut against your teamês hated rivals, but itês a result thatês bound to put a couple extra bounces in GM Pierre Dorionês steps. For a team thatês used four goaltenders in their first ten games, only allowing one goal against in their last three must be pretty sweet.  Mike Hoffman scored the lone goal of the game by patiently outwaiting a sprawling Jakob Markstrom after Ottawa-native Erik Gudbranson turned the puck over in Vancouverês defensive zone. Derick Brassard doesnêt earn an assist on the play, but his forecheck of Ben Hutton led to the Canucks sophomore putting the puck in a bad position for Gudbranson, which led to the subsequent turnover. Here are a couple of thoughts on the Sens third win in a row:  1. The Sens 5-on-5 shots against totals in their last five games, in chronological order: 21, 18, 30, 26, 22. Last season, the Sens only had 4 independent five-game segments in which they kept the opposing teams to <25 shots in three of the five games. Now, the worrywart in me looks at the fact that the Sens have only won the shot attempt battle three times all season (v. Montreal, Detroit, and Calgary) and although two of those games were losses, we care about shot attempts because theyêre generally more predictive of on-ice performance than a lower event variable (like shots on goal, goals, and wins). Interestingly, there seems to be a pretty stark difference in the teamês Corsi (all shot attempts) and Fenwick (unblocked shot attempts) numbers, likely owing to the fact that Boucherês been asking all members of his team to lay out and block more shots, especially compared to recent years. As usual, Ottawa was led by their captain, who blocked 5 shots tonight and rank among the league leaders in that category. It certainly matches up to what our eyes are seeing, and in the numbers as well; Ottawa gave up 64 shot attempts tonight against compared to 39 unblocked shot attempts   a net difference of 25. If we extrapolate that to league-wide results, the Senators currently rank a poor 22nd in score-adjusted Corsi (48.3%), but an above-average 12th in score-adjusted Fenwick (51.1%).  2. The Senators powerplay looked godawful tonight in their 0/4 performance, only managing to generate 1 shot on goal total (!). The team is now 3/27 on the season. Interestingly, Ryan, Hoffman, Turris, and Brassard all played more on the powerplay than Erik Karlssonês 2:58, but that was likely because Karlsson has been playing a lot more on the PK, where heês been effective. Boucher has generally kept his third pair of Borowiecki - Wideman (or Claesson tonight) off of the PK, which is a much needed turn of events after last seasonês PK disaster. It certainly helps that Karlssonês been extremely effective on the penalty kill so far this year, fronting a lot of shots and reacting quick in order to get pucks out cleanly. Back to the powerplay, it really seems like the problem is due to stagnation once the team sets up. Thereês very little puck movement, with the team often engaging in puck battles down low, trying a low-percentage point shot with a screen in front of the net, or sending the puck around the boards back up to the point. Itês pretty symptomatic of their offence as a whole right now, and if it wasnêt for strong goaltending, weêd likely be complaining about only scoring 5 goals in 3 games. The teamês offence, lauded as a strong point coming into the year (_We have 9 twenty-goal scorersÓ), is 18th in 5-on-5 GF% with 16 goals in 10 games.  ",Nucks Misconduct,Vancouverês Scoring Woes Continue in Ottawa,"Coming into this game, fans find themselves asking an all too familiar question, _Where are the goals?Ó The Vancouver Canucks hoped to answer that question against the Ottawa Senators tonight in the second game in their six game road trip out East. Despite doubling the Montreal Canadiens in shots last night (42), the Canucks were still unable to find a way to get on the board. Mike Condon was in net for his first time as a Senator tonight after being acquired yesterday for a fifth-round pick from the Pittsburgh Penguins. Ottawa is trying to solidify their net presence while Craig Anderson is taking some much needed time away with his wife Nicholle. We also saw some changes to the lineup tonight with Nikita Tryamkin playing his first game of the season on a pairing with Luca Sbisa while Philip Larsen fills in for Chris Tanev on the top pairing. The game was hard fought with Vancouver consistently generating chances off takeaways. However, they still seemed to be fighting the puck when it came to actually getting it in the net. While the Canucks played consistent, strong hockey and stepped on the gas at the end of the game, there was once again no reward for their effort. Mike Condon walked away with a 27 save shutout and the Vancouver Canucks find themselves in a 7 game losing streak. First Period: The Canucks kicked off the game with some great pressure. The Sedins and Janik Hansen generated some shots on net to test Condon early and Tryamkin had a few attempts throughout the period. The Canucks had active sticks in every zone in the opening period. They werenêt allowing Ottawa into the zone easily and produced some nice chances after creating turnovers. Just over five minutes into the game, Derek Dorsett and Mark Borowiecki kicked off the first fight of the night. This would be followed by Nikita Tryamkin against Zack Smith later in the period after Tryamkin hit Chris Kelly. Once again, the Penalty Killing unit displayed lots of confidence which allowed them to play aggressively. Nikita Tryamkin even spent some time on the PK, using his reach to clear the zone. At the end of the period, Bo Horvat and Eric Karlson got into a scuffle after an exchange ended with Horvat removing Karlsonês helmet. It wasnêt much of a fight and both went to the box for Roughing (Horvat with the 4 minute minor). Second Period: It was a strange start to the middle frame with a linesman getting hit with a puck on Erik Gudbransonês clearing attempt. He left the game but able to return later on. The puck was not going the Canucks way tonight, there were a lot of missed chances, bad bounces and fanned shots. Later, in the second period, Erik Karlsson and a few of his teammates attempted to get even with Bo Horvat. Unfortunately for them, Horvat seems to have developed some sort of spider sense. The continuous misplays and failure to capitalize on scoring chance came to a head when Mike Hoffman got a break in front of the net. After blocking a combined clearing attempt from Ben Hutton and Erik Gudbranson, Hoffman was able to get around Jacob Markstromês diving poke check and put away the only goal of the game. Markstrom was quick to regain his composure with a series of great saves to end the second period and attempt to keep the Canucks in the game. Third Period: Unfortunately, it was more of the same in the third period. Whether itês a stick, skate or even a ref, the Canucks were hitting everything but the back of the net tonight. With eleven minutes remaining, we saw the Baertschi, Horvat and Virtanen line reunited in an attempt by Willie Desjardin to generate some much needed offence. Sven Baertschi (who is still trying to get his first goal of the season) had an excellent chance when he sent a blistering shot of a nice pass from Horvat but couldnêt get it over Condonês glove. The Vancouver Canucks brought a ton of pressure into the last half of the third period. They seemed poised to tie it up after continued pressure but Mike Condon made save after save to keep the scoreless Canucks frustrated and off the board. Theyêre now 4-6-1 and 5th in the Pacific Division after being shut out four times in five games. With their World Series win last night, the Chicago Cubs offered a ray of hope for franchises with a long history of failing to win it all. But Vancouver fans sure hope they can turn it around sooner rather than later.  "
11,1 Regular,11/5/2016,7:00 PM,,Buffalo Sabres,1,2,L,,7,4,0,L 1,33,2,1,4,0,32,6,0,1,0,"16,225",2:23,"Sam Reinhart scores tiebreaker, Sabres beat Senators 2-1","The Ottawa Senators were hoping one day Robin Lehner would be their No. 1 goalie. On Saturday night, he came back to town and beat them as a member of the Buffalo Sabres. Acquired from Ottawa before last season, Lehner made 31 saves in Buffalo's 2-1 comeback victory.  That's the big reason why we won,  Sabres forward Sam Reinhart said about Lehner's play.  He was the one guy for the full 60 minutes that gave it his all and was really the big reason why we won that game.  Kyle Okposo and Reinhart scored in the third period to help the Sabres rally for their fourth win in five games. Okposo tied it early in the period when he tipped a point shot from Jake McCabe past Craig Anderson. The Sabres took their first lead when Reinhart took advantage of a turnover at the side of the Ottawa goal. Anderson stopped the first shot, but Reinhart was able to jam a loose puck in between the skate of Anderson and the post at 8:22.  It was kind of an in-tight play and kind of lucky the way it worked out and was able to come back and be on the right side of the goalie,  Reinhart said. The Senators had an opportunity to tie it with a four-minute power play after Dmitry Kulikov got a high stick into the face of Bobby Ryan, but were unable to produce. Mike Hoffman scored for Ottawa, and Anderson made 30 saves.  I think the game could have went either way and I think both teams played pretty good and had chances but Lehner did play really well,  Hoffman said.  We were generating chances, which is, at the end of the day, what we want to do. Some days they're going to go in, unfortunately this was one of those days that things didn't go our way.  NOTES: The Sabres have won back-to-back games against the Senators for the first time in five years. ... Sabres forward William Carrier played his first NHL game. UP NEXT: The Sabres will conclude their two-game road swing against Boston on Monday night before returning home for a rematch with the Senators on Wednesday night. The Senators are at Nashville on Tuesday night.  ",Callum Fraser,Senators Fall to Sabres 2-1 on #HockeyFightsCancer Night,"It was only fitting that on #HockeyFightsCancer night at the Canadian Tire Centre, Senators goaltender Craig Anderson returned from his leave of absence to start in goal against the Buffalo Sabres. With his wife Nicholle battling cancer and Anderson leaving when he must to be with his family, the crowd - which was one of the bigger audiences Kanata has seen this year - absolutely went off when his name was finally announced before the anthems. #HockeyFightsCancer cards were being handed out pre-game, there was a definite rivalry in the stands and Stuntman Stu and 13-year-old Justin LeBlanc (Stu battling leukemia and Justin battling Ewingês sarcoma) came to centre ice for the ceremonial puck drop. It was a special night. When the real puck was dropped, the Senators looked like they had an extra jump in their step - something that was definitely missing the past several games. Midway through the first period, Ottawa extended their streak to 13 consecutive successful trips to the PK when they killed off Chris Kellyês high-sticking penalty. The home team would get a chance of their own on the man advantage, though, when Mike Hoffman drew a tripping penalty. Though they havenêt been able to convert as much as was anticipated with Guy Boucherês influence on the power play, the big positive is how little the team ever resorts to a dump-in. Itês controlled zone entry after controlled zone entry, and when the entry is perfected, the rest will begin to fall into place. And later on it did. After the Sabres were called for too many men on the ice, a quick passing play between Erik Karlsson and Bobby Ryan ended with a laser from Mike Hoffman that found the back of the net. There isnêt a single goal scorer in the NHL that is overly consistent. Nearly every player that is famous for beating goaltenders is a streaky scorer. And after failing to score a single goal in his first seven games, Hoffman had three in his last four. The Sabres came out far better in the third frame than they had the previous two. And it resulted in a completed comeback. Donêt let the score fool you. Ottawa may have lost 2-1, but it was arguably their best game of the season. They played with speed, created a number of quality scoring chances and their breakout was flawless. Maybe itês just the fact that they were due for a loss after a few unimpressive wins against lower tier teams, but nonetheless, there are a great deal of positives to take from it. Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman When Hoffman has a great effort on both sides of the puck, it works out in the offensive zone. Tonight, he was responsible in his own end and electric in Buffaloês. There are fewer snipers in the league that are able to get open for a one timer as easy as Mike Hoffman, and it showed tonight. Honourable Mention: Erik Karlsson The Senators captain was extremely effective in his own end tonight. He was hard to play against when the Sabres were cycling and whether he was passing the puck or taking it himself, he quarterbacked the breakout with precision. Sens Killer: Robin Lehner When asked if he thought Lehner enjoys beating his old team, Sabres head coach exclaimed _absolutely.Ó It was an unbelievable performance. In hind sight, Ottawa had a handful of opportunities that seemed to be sure goals. Lehner was outstanding when he needed to be, followed the point shots with ease and shut down the Senators in the second half of the third period when Buffalo got into some penalty trouble.   ",Die By the Blade,Lehner stands strong in 2-1 road win,"The Sabres have been one of the best teams in the NHL on the road this season, but tonight, they needed their goaltenderês best effort of the year just to keep them in it until they could find their legs in the third period, and come from behind to beat the Ottawa Senators 2-1. As improved as the teamês overall effort has been this year, the Sabres struggled hard to get things going out of the gate tonight. If you look at the basic scoresheet, it doesnêt look too bad, but Buffalo had very few high-danger scoring chances and couldnêt sustain any kind of pressure in the Ottawa zone for the first two periods. Their forecheck was nonexistent, and Robin Lehner had to make more than a few fantastic saves in the first two periods just to keep the score at 1-0, thanks to a second period Ottawa goal from Mike Hoffman. The team finally found their legs in the third, striking quickly out of the gate thanks to Kyle Okposo, who scored his team-leading fifth goal by deflecting a Jake McCabe shot past Craig Anderson to tie the game at one. Just minutes later, with the Sabres buzzing in the Ottawa zone, Sam Reinhart shoved a Girgensons rebound past Chris Neil and Anderson to give the Sabres a 2-1 lead, which they would manage to hold until the final whistle. Things looked bleak when Dmitry Kulikov took a four minute penalty late in the third thanks to drawing blood on a ugly high stick to Bobby Ryan, but the Sabres did a fantastic job shutting Ottawa down for all four minutes.  Despite yet another empty net post hit in the final minute, the Sabres managed to hold on for a 2-1 road win. It was their first win of the season after giving up the first goal, and it was largely thanks to the heroics of Robin Lehner, who played extremely well tonight as the team in front of him took 40 minutes to warm up.  Two Questions 1. What impact will Will Carrier have in his NHL debut? Not a ton, though he only got 6:26 of ice time. Carrier did manage two shots and four hits in that time, however, so thatês a pretty strong rate of play in his debut. Also, it should be noted he led the rush into the zone that developed into Sam Reinhartês game winning goal. 2. Can the Sabres find their offense? In the third period, yes. In the first two periods, good lord no.  "

Nashville's goalie made a huge save early on, and James Neal and P.K. Subban each had a goal and an assist to lead the Predators over the Ottawa Senators 3-1 on Tuesday night. Ryan Ellis also scored for Nashville, and Rinne stopped 33 shots. The Predators had lost their previous two games in shootouts. Rinne's best save came at 5:59 of the first period. After defenseman Mattias Ekholm turned the puck over inside the Nashville zone, Ottawa's Bobby Ryan had an unchallenged shot from the slot that Rinne stopped to keep the game scoreless.  Of course that gives you confidence,  Rinne said.  The crowd's response and everything like that, it's a big boost. That's one of those things that you just battle to make that save and once in a while, you get that save.  It was one of 13 stops Rinne made in the opening period.  I did everything right on it,  Ryan said.  You're supposed to raise the puck and go for the far side. He made an incredible save. So sometimes you tip your cap.  Kyle Turris scored and Craig Anderson made 27 saves for Ottawa, which has lost consecutive games. Nashville has defeated the Senators in five of the last six matchups. Neal scored the game's first goal 46 seconds into the second. On a delayed penalty to the Senators, Subban carried the puck around the Ottawa zone. He passed to Roman Josi, who found Neal in the slot, where he fired a shot past Anderson.  The first 10 games, to be honest with you, I don't think I've really been at my best,  Subban said.  I don't know why that is, but I'm just fluid and skating out there. This game, I just felt better and I felt I had my legs under me. When I feel that way, I can create and open up some space.  Subban doubled the Nashville lead at 3:52 of the second on a slap shot from the right point through traffic. Subban had been held without a goal in his last seven games.  P.K., I thought, was real good,  Nashville coach Peter Laviolette said.  I thought he got the puck out of our end well. He got out of our end with speed sometimes and jumped into the offense. When we got to the offensive zone, I thought he did a good job of picking and choosing his spots to add offensively.  Both of Subban's points came at even strength. Entering the game, five of his six points had come on the power play. Ellis made it 3-0 at 2:23 of the third with a slap shot from the top of the right circle. The goal was his first of the season. Turris ruined Rinne's shutout bid at 5:20 of the third with his team-leading sixth goal.  They are a free-wheeling team,  Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said.  They've got high-end skill and we didn't want to fall into their game, but we did. We tried to get it back after that and we hurt ourselves. We had a push in the third, but we couldn't get that second one there to keep that push going. We got away from how we play.  NOTES: Nashville C Mike Fisher missed his third consecutive game with an upper-body injury. ... Predators LW Pontus Aberg made his NHL regular-season debut. He appeared in two playoff games for Nashville last season. ... The Senators successfully killed off all three Nashville power plays. Ottawa has not allowed a power-play goal in its last seven games. UP NEXT Senators: Travel to Buffalo on Wednesday. Predators: Host the St. Louis Blues on Thursday.  ",Callum Fraser,Predators Down Senators 3-1 on Election Night,"While the U.S. election was dominating TV screens across North America, there was still a hockey game to be played in Nashville. And if you didnêt tune into the Senators - err, the ones on the ice - then all the more reason why we always have your recap here at Silver Seven. Craig Anderson was in net for his second straight start as his family continues to deal with Nicholleês cancer diagnosis. The 35-year-old Illinois native had been outstanding as of late, recording two shutouts and three wins in his last four games. And he was rather stellar again in Nashville. In the early goings, it was deja vu for the Senators after their battle with the Sabres in which Robin Lehner came across multiple times to make unbelievable saves. Now, it was Pekka Rinne they would be seeing in their nightmares. Bobby Ryan had loads of time and a wide open cage to fire home his fourth goal of the season, but he took one-too-many seconds to shoot and Rinne made a miraculous stop raising his left pad nearly a foot off the ground. Ryan has one goal in his last eight games. The second period started with a bang for the Predators. And it was an old, friendly face torturing the Senators once again.  Though he and his team had been off to a rough start to the season, P.K. Subban was on fire Tuesday night. With his patented spin-o-rama and playmaking ability giving Nashville their first goal, Subbanês impressive shot generation led to their second. But the Preds werenêt done there. Ryan Ellis found a bit of room at the top of the circle and wired one over the glove of Anderson. If you subscribe to the notion that Ottawa tends to give up a ton of career first and slump busters, well, thereês another notch. After 12 games, Ellis finally had his first of the 2016-17 campaign. In the third, Anderson battled hard. Though the Senators led by a small margin in the shot category, Nashville was hammering them in shot attempts and zone time. And on top of that, the quality of opportunities were definitely in favour of the home team. The Predators would end up leading the scoring chance race 23-16. But it wasnêt all doom and gloom. Ryan Dzingel reminded Sens fans that he was still on pace for a career year when he won a huge battle down low with Ellis harassing him. The 24-year-old broke free of Ellisê hold, skated around the net and found Kyle Turris in the slot for his sixth of the year. The Senators had life. But it was quickly taken away. Midway through the final frame, Zack Smith had a great opportunity to cut the lead to one with a partially screened Rinne and the net just 15 feet away, but the Predators netminder was equal to the task. Mike Hoffman would send a one-timer towards the twine in the dying seconds, but again, Rinne stood tall. When the final buzzer sounded, the Senators had been handed their second straight loss in regulation and were 7-5-0 to start the season. Sens Hero(es): Kyle Turris and Ryan Dzingel Now on pace for 41 goals, it feels like he and Dzingel have been the Senatorsê most consistent forwards. While Turris missed a large almost 30 games last season with a leg injury and Dzingel found it a bit difficult to play a regular role with the NHL club, both have had a major influence on Ottawaês success early on. Sens Killer No. 1: Pekka Rinne Thatês two games in a row now that it seems a goaltender has singlehandedly taken away at least a point from the Senators. Rinne 33 of 24 shots en route to a much needed victory for a Predators team now only two points out of a playoff spot. Sens Killer No. 2: P.K. Subban At least this time it wasnêt at the cost of one of Mark Stoneês limbs.  ",On the Forecheck,Offense + Rinne = Win Column,"This game was exactly what the Predators needed after bad, back-to-back, shootout losses to the Coyotes and Hurricanes.  Nashville got off to a sluggish start for the first 10 minutes of the first period, but turned things around and played much better over the last 10 minutes of the frame. The Predators still whiffed on several scoring chances but put forth a better offensive effort than they had been producing. Pekka Rinne made what could be a save of the year nominee after a Mattias Ekholm turnover in front of the net.  James Neal got the scoring started in the second period for his third goal of the season. He has really come on strong over the last handful of games and stepped up with Ryan Johansen and Filip Forsberg still in goal-scoring timeout.  P.K. Subban, who had an assist on Nealês goal, tallied his third goal and team-leading eighth point, to double the Predators lead 2-0. Rinne shutout the Senators for the first two periods and looked really sharp.  Ryan Ellis made an appearance on the score sheet, ripping a goal past Craig Anderson and the Predators ran their lead to 3-0. Kyle Turris tacked on a goal for Ottawa and the shutout is no more.  Overall, a much better effort from this team. It was nice to see they didnêt just talk about playing a complete game but actually did so.  Random Observations Craig Smith with a big whiff right in front of the net. Just imagine if he scored on half of the almosts and misses he accumulates.  PEKKA RINNE. That might have been save of the year.  The flip side to that: a terrible, terrible turnover by Ekholm in his own end.  The Predators talked the last few days about playing a complete game and giving better effort, so far that hasnêt been the case in the first period.  Predators the first 10 minutes: bad hockey. Predators the last 10 minutes: good hockey.  What in the world is going on with Filip Forsberg?  The kind of puck possession P.K. Subban had tonight is what everyone expected from this team from game one.  Neal has been picking it up these last few games, now they just need Johansen and Forsberg to follow suit.  Hey there, Ryan Ellis! Now, THIS is the Predators team everyone has been waiting to see.  OTFês Super Duper Stars of the Night P.K. Subban - he was all over the ice tonight. His puck possession on the James Neal goal was a thing of beauty. He is starting to put up the offensive numbers the Predators were expecting when they traded for him.  Pekka Rinne - 32 saves on 33 shots? Nashville will take that all night long. Much has been said about how Rinne would perform this season, but he has fared pretty well; especially the last handful of games.  James Neal - Itês hard to believe he only has three goals. But a good sign as it appears Neal is heating up at just the right time for Nashville.  "

Bobby Ryan and Kyle Turris scored during a shootout, helping the Senators beat the Buffalo Sabres 2-1. Backup goaltender Mike Condon made 31 saves, including eight in overtime, as the Senators rebounded from a 3-1 loss in Nashville on Tuesday and avenged a 2-1 loss to the Sabres at home Saturday. ""That's a lot of resiliency,"" Boucher said. ""I'm really proud of the guys because that's a tough back-to-back."" Turris scored in the first round of the shootout to match Sam Reinhart's tally, and then Ryan put Ottawa ahead in the second round. Condon stopped Brian Gionta on Buffalo's final attempt. Ryan Dzingel got a tying goal for Ottawa 7:15 into the second period. Nicholas Baptiste scored for Buffalo, and former Senator Robin Lehner made 28 saves while the Sabres lost their second in a row. Buffalo controlled the action throughout overtime, outshooting Ottawa 8-0. ""We just possessed the puck the whole time for the most part and had some glorious chances to win the game,"" Sabres coach Dan Bylsma said. Zemgus Girgensons got a point-blank shot past Condon with 27 seconds remaining, but the puck ricocheted off the back of condon 's skate and the left post. ""It's funny how puck luck works,"" Sabres defenseman Jake McCabe said. ""Hopefully one of these days, the puck's going to bounce our way. But we just got to keep doing the right things, create our own luck."" Condon has won both of his starts for the Senators since being acquired in a trade with Pittsburgh on Nov. 2. He made 27 saves in a 1-0 shutout of Vancouver in his debut. ""It's great for a guy to come in and make his presence known like that,"" Dzingel said. ""Hats off to him. Two great games."" Baptiste gave Buffalo a 1-0 lead 2:49 into the first. Derek Grant's faceoff win and a quick pass from Cole Schneider set up Baptiste's wrist shot from the left circle. It was Baptiste's second career goal and Schneider's first point. The Senators tied it when Dzingel split defensemen Dmitry Kulikov and Rasmus Ristolainen and lifted a shot from the left slot over Lehner's blocking pad. Dzingel has scored four of his five goals on the road this season. Buffalo killed three penalties spanning 4:36 in the second period, including a 5-on-3 that lasted 1:24. Forward Evander Kane returned to the Sabres top line after missing 11 games with cracked ribs, but Buffalo was still without its top two centers, Ryan O'Reilly and Jack Eichel. O'Reilly is day-to-day with an upper body injury, Bylsma said. Eichel has yet to play this season due to a high ankle sprain, but Bylsma said he could be cleared for on-ice workouts next week. NOTES: Senators F Chris Neil missed the game with an undisclosed injury. Ottawa recalled F Mike Blunden to replace Neil on the fourth line. ... F Tyler Ennis sat out for Buffalo with a mid-body injury. ... Buffalo recalled Schneider from the minors and sent down F Hudson Fasching. Schneider was tied for the AHL scoring lead with 15 points. UP NEXT: Senators: Host Los Angeles on Friday. Sabres: Host New Jersey on Friday.  ",nkb,Sens top Sabres 2-1 in the Shootout,"Thirteen games into the season, we're still trying to come a conclusion about what we have in this year's edition of the Ottawa Senators. There have been stretches of good play, but there have equally been patches of uninspired slop. We're left perpetually searching for benchmarks, anything against which to measure the outfit's progress (or lack thereof). A Wednesday night game, in November, in Buffalo, on the second night of a back-to-back, against an improving Sabres squad, provided just such a test. The Sens, thanks in large part to the late game heroics of Mike Condon, passed tonight's exam...but just barely. Teams, both coaches and players, like to downplay the importance of fatigue but it's very real, and it has very tangible effects on the tired team. Throughout most of tonight's first period, the Senators certainly looked the part of a tired team. They were pinned in their own end for long stretches and when they were able to exit the zone, they rarely threatened Robin Lehner's net (as evidenced by their measly two scoring chances compared to the Sabres' six). The Sabres opened the scoring less than three minutes into the game off what may have been a set play on an offensive zone draw. Cole Schneider, former Binghamton Senators hero, tipped a loose puck back to Nicholas Baptiste who rifled one off of condon 's glove and into the back of the net. The commentators observed that the goal was probably one the Sens' keeper would have liked back, but given how he played the rest of the game that one error was soon forgiven. As aforementioned the Senators did not fare much better for the rest of the period and might have been a bit lucky to escape down just one. The second period, however, was the Senators' redemption and they carried the play throughout (save one 90 second stretch when it seemed like the Sens would never exit their own end again). If you haven't already seen it, the highlight was certainly Ryan Dzingel's solo effort to equalize just over seven minutes into the period. Dzingel has been easily the most pleasant surprise on the team and flashes of skill like this won't hurt his cause going forward. Perhaps the key juncture of the game arrived with just over two and a half minutes left in the frame, when Ottawa was gifted a nearly 90 second 5-on-3 thanks to some careless stick work from Derek Grant while the Sabres were already down a player. The Sens' powerplay has been the punching bag for many fans and analysts alike, but it says here that they've moved the puck well and generated a tonne of shots on net; at some point, they're going to break through in a meaningful way. This powerplay was no different: the Sens moved the puck around well and created several high quality chances but were unable to find a way past Lehner. The third period was a virtual deadlock, and besides some scary moments right at the end of regulation the Senators deserved the point they secured by making it to the extra frame. Overtime, on the other hand, was unkind to Ottawa. The Sabres outshot the Sens 7-0, out-attempted them 10-0, and just generally ran roughshod up and down the ice. Making it to the shootout was only, and I mean only, the work of Condon and his posts. Once there, the Sens seemed to remember all the ways past Lehner. Both Kyle Turris and Bobby Ryan scored on their attempts with ease. Meanwhile, Condon stopped two of the three shots he faced and Ottawa escaped with two points. We're still not sure exactly what this team is, but considering it was the second night of a back-to-back the regulation part of the game was more than fine. Let's just forget the overtime ever happened. NKB's 3 Quick Thoughts: -I understand Guy boucher 's trying to go for three balanced groups by breaking up the Hoffman-Stone-Turris trio and putting one on each line, but I can't see how letting Hoffman languish on the nominal third line is helpful to the team as a whole. Pyatt and Pageau can certainly skate with Hoffman, but they lack the offensive skills and instincts to truly mesh with the talented left winger. Instead of boucher 's vision of a balanced, continuous attack we're left with three mediocre forward sets. The HST line has been fantastic in its limited time together and the offense badly needs juicing; re-uniting his three best forwards would be the first place I'd start if I was Boucher. And this time, stick with it for more than a game! -The Fredrik Claesson - Mark Borowiecki pairing has struggled badly at times since Chris Wideman was hurt and Claesson was recalled; unfortunately, tonight was not one of their finer performances. The Sens got bludgeoned when they were on the ice despite cushy deployment and the two saw limited ice time. Here's to hoping Wideman is healthy and able to go sooner than later. -Erik Karlsson is so good at catching players and stripping them of the puck that it sometimes startles even the referees. On the occasion of his hooking penalty tonight, I think the referee was so shocked that Karlsson had stripped Marcus Foligno of the puck that there *had* to have been a hook. Nope, just a clean lift of the stick. Sens Hero: Ryan Dzingel The goal was a thing of beauty, but he also made several great plays with the puck through the neutral zone to create attacking chances. The Sens generally struggled to generate offense on this evening, but Dzingel was a clear bright spot. Sens Hero: Mike Condon condon 's stopped all but one of the 65 shots he's faced in his first two games as a Senators. He's the real deal, folks. Sens Killer: Robin Lehner It seems like there's always a lot to say about Lehner any time he plays the Senators, but he was great tonight and let's just leave it at that.   ",Die By the Blade,"Sabres stumble against Sens, lose 2-1","Desperate, I was seeking respite from America's version of Brexit. A hockey game was what I went with. On the heels of a pitiful showing against the hated Boston Bruins on Monday, the Buffalo Sabres hosted a struggling Senators squad. Could they pull off a win in front of the new Divided States of America crowd before them? Just three minutes into the game, Derek Grant won a face off in the Ottawa zone, directly leading to the second goal of the season for rookie Nicholas Baptiste. Called up from the AHL's Rochester Americans earlier in the day, Cole Schneider picked up an assist, for the first NHL point of his career. A bit of redemption on the play for Grant, a former Senators draft pick, and Schneider, former Ottawa property. It was a fairly matched affair in the period, as the teams were equal with 8 shots apiece. In the second period, Ottawa was hoping to buck their trend of scoring two goals or less in 7 of their last 8 games. Seven minutes in, Ryan Dzingel ignited those hopes for Senators fans, when he split the Sabres defensive pairing of Dmitri Kulikov and Rasmus Ristolainen in a slick play to beat Robin Lehner, and tie the game at 1-1. Later in the period, Buffalo displayed some defensive heroics, in killing off a 90 second Senators two man advantage. Near the end of the sequence, the Sabres missed a golden opportunity for a short handed two man breakaway on an errant outlet pass. in the third stanza, Buffalo continued the trend of blowing great chances. The Sabres were handed a gift horse when Erik Karlsson was called for hooking on a Marcus Folignoopportunity, on what looked to me to be a clean defensive play. Buffalo, in what became the recurring theme of the night, wasted their chances. As the game progressed into the 3-on-3 overtime, the Sabres dominated possession, maintaining the puck for 3:20 of the 5 minutes. Zemgus Girgensons had the clearest attempt at winning the game; alas, his shot bounced off a crossbar, then off of the left post, before the puck decided not to enter the net. In the shootout, Sam Reinhart shot the puck through the five-hole of Senators goalie Condon in the first attempt. Ottawa's Kyle Turris responded with five-hole goal of his own on Robin Lehner. Kyle Okposo and Brian Gionta were both stymied by Condon stick-checks, while Bobby Ryanjuked Lehner to the ground for an easy win. Evander Kane returned from his cracked ribs  tonight, and Dan Bylsma did not ease him back in, as Kane skated over 20 minutes in regulation. The team was without Tyler Ennis and Ryan O'Reilly, which seemed to disjoint any solid chemistry amongst the top two lines of Buffalo. It was Rip Simonik's 3500th game for the Sabres, as he is now the last original member of the inaugural team of 1970. Josh Gorges played exceptionally well tonight. He stopped a Sens breakaway chance in the first period, and was soundly blocking shots later in the game. Jake McCabe continues to be a quiet surprise, playing solidly defensively and looking fluid offensively when given open ice. I have not been a fan of Derek Grant thus far, but he was dominant in the face off circle with O'Reilly absent. When I last checked, he had won 85% of his draws. Marcus Foligno was in beast mode tonight, bringing physicality and offensive chances with it. Buffalo, at this point, lacks finish in their game. Lehner has been great. With a fully healthy lineup, I am confident that they can be contenders. Yet, will that day ever come? The best teams in the league know how to win minus stars in the ilk of Jack Eichel, but Buffalo could not get it done tonight, on home ice, in a game they could have won.  "

Smith batted in his own rebound with just under four minutes left to play to tie it before Mark Stone scored with 7 seconds to go as Ottawa rallied past the Los Angeles Kings 2-1 on Friday night.  I have to give a shout out to my old baseball team, the Maple Creek Mohawks,  Smith said.  My teammates could attest I wasn't a very good hitter but I think I redeemed myself with that one.  Stone tracked down a loose puck in the crease and gave the Senators the lead less than four minutes after Smith tied the game.  We stuck together for the full game, kept believing in our game plan and it paid off at the end,  said Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who had two assists.  We had a lot of chances and you get a little frustrated but you have to keep up with what you're doing. If you're getting chances it means you're doing good things.  The Senators had totaled just four goals in their previous four games. Dwight King scored early in the second period for the Kings. Jeff Zatkoff had a shutout going through the first two periods, stopping all 18 shots the Senators sent his way. However, after recently came off the injury reserved list with a lower body injury, Zatkoff pulled himself after the second period. Peter Budaj, who had a shutout streak of 140:57 snapped Thursday night in Montreal, came on to start the third and stopped the first 12 shots he faced. Smith was then able to bat his own rebound out of the air and in with 3:54 remaining to tie it.  Zatkoff made some pretty crazy saves there on us. We were getting chances, which was helping us stick to it,  Smith said.  I think that's important to know that we can stick around all game and if you have to wait for the last couple of minutes to score then so be it. I thought we were good all game.  Budaj finished with 13 stops. Craig Anderson was the busiest of the three goalies in the game as he stopped 32 shots.  We played as good as we could. We were a little overstaffed in the third and we knew they were going to come hard,  Kings coach Darryl Sutter said.  They have a lot of forwards who drive the net and both their goals were scored when we had defensemen lying around the net, so we lost a couple of battles there.  The Kings had the lone power play of the first period and outshot the Senators 14-8 but were unable to get anything past Anderson. Los Angeles came closest to a goal when Nick Shore used a nifty toe-drag to get around Senators forward Ryan Dzingel and beat Anderson with a shot but it hit the post to keep the game scoreless. Jeff Carter initially got credit for the Kings' goal 56 seconds, but replays showed his backhander through traffic appeared to hit King's left leg before going in. Anze Kopitar was stopped point-blank by Anderson on the power play and then missed the net on a short-handed breakaway later in the second. The Senators had a 22-second 5-on-3 advantage in the period but didn't manage a shot. NOTES: Chris Wideman and Mike Blunden were scratches for the Senators. ...

",Ross A,Stone lifts Sens to 2-1 victory with last-minute goal,"The L.A. Kings controlled most of the play in this game, but they fell into a bit of a shell in the third period and the Ottawa Senators made them pay, eventually scoring the winning goal with just 6.5 seconds left on the clock. Tonightês game featured the semi-annual battle between Flashy European Erik Karlsson and Greatest Defenceman Alive [Cherry, LeBrun, Poulin et al. (2016)] Drew Doughty. This game didnêt quite have the hype of last year, likely because Karlsson/Doughty became the dominant storyline down the stretch, while this year we havenêt even played a month of hockey yet. The opening period I think was quintessential Kings hockey. I felt like Ottawa didnêt play badly, but the final shot tally was 14-8 for L.A. They arenêt flashy, but they wear down teams by just being consistently better. Luckily for Ottawa, Craig Anderson was up to the task, and the teams left the period tied 0-0. The second period saw the Kings take the lead, off an impressive backhander from Jeff Carterthat Anderson couldnêt quite see as it tipped off Dwight King in front. The velocity on that shot was pretty impressive for a backhander. The Kings would follow it up with a powerplay, but some great work by Anderson kept them in the game. Ottawa would get a glorious set of chances when the Kings took a too many men penalty while already killing a penalty, giving the Senators 22 seconds of 5-on-3. For what felt like the 100th time this season (but was probably more like the fourth), the Sens couldnêt get a goal in the 5-on-3. Or on the powerplay at all. The Sensê awful powerplay dropped to 10% on the season after this game. The third period started weirdly, with Peter Budaj suddenly in net. It appeared that after shutting out the Sens through two periods in his first start in nearly a month, Jeff Zatkoff was injured (again). Things went from bad to worse for the Kings with Anze Kopitar leaving the bench momentarily, and then leaving for the rest of the game after just one more shift.  Budaj picked up where Zatkoff left off, stopping everything the Sens threw his way until there were just four minutes left in the game. Zack Smith took a shot that Budaj struggled with, and then batted his own rebound out of the air into the net. The Kings would challenge for goaltender interference because Mark Stone had got the better of Jake Muzzin in front and the latter fell at Budajês feet, but the goal stood. Then the unthinkable happened. As time ran out and overtime loomed, Erik Karlsson faked a shot from the point before firing one at the net that fell through Budajês five-hole, and Mark Stone snuck in behind and put it into the net. The Sens clinched the victory with just 6.5 seconds left. Sens Hero: Mark Stone Stone was looking dangerous as the game went on, and he finally got his goal (and his patented zealous celebration) at almost the literal final second. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson If the Sens are only going to score one goal per game from here on out, theyêre going to need him at his best. Sens Zero: TSN Whose idea was it to name Mark Borowiecki the third star for _three hits and a blockÓ? Smith and Pageau had three hits. Karlsson had four blocks. Phaneuf was looking in the offensive zone, Ceci couldêve had three goals, Hoffman got a number of great looks off... anyway, this one really felt like someone was looking for a reason to give Boro a call-out. He wasnêt bad in this game, donêt get me wrong, just not the kind of player you highlight.  ",,,
15,1 Regular,11/13/2016,5:00 PM,,Minnesota Wild,1,2,L,OT,9,5,1,L 1,36,6,0,4,0,42,8,0,3,1,"14,265",2:35,Dumba scores in OT to lift Wild over Senators 2-1,"For a team playing its third game in four nights, the Minnesota Wild looked plenty fresh on Sunday night -- even in overtime. Matt Dumba scored late in the extra session and Darcy Kuemper stopped 35 shots, helping Minnesota beat the Ottawa Senators 2-1. The Wild were coming off a 3-2 loss to Philadelphia on Saturday after beating Pittsburgh on Thursday.  It's not the end of the world to play back-to-backs, and I thought we held on and did a good job,  Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. Ryan Suter scored a short-handed goal in the first period and Kuemper helped the Wild kill off three early power plays.  We're not a team that wants to get behind 3-0, so getting those three kills and getting out of the first period with a lead was really important for us I'd say,  Boudreau said. Craig Anderson made 40 saves and was again solid for the Senators, who got a goal from Kyle Turris 5:06 into the third period. Ottawa has 11 goals over its last eight games and are 1 for 24 on the power play.  I love the way we're playing, we're giving ourselves a chance to win by being there at the end,  Anderson said.  The positive out of not scoring right now is that even though guys might be showing some frustration, they're still doing their jobs on the defensive side of the puck which is allowing us to get points and give ourselves an opportunity to be in each game.  Despite their hectic schedule of late, the Wild controlled much of the action with Ottawa looking disorganized for most of the night.  We had all kinds of scoring chances, but we just can't find the back of the net,  Senators coach Guy Boucher said.  It's a matter of creating the same chances and then having some go in and you're able to relax and not grip the stick so tight.  Turris finally got Ottawa on the board when he beat Kuemper far stick-side with a wrist shot. boucher 's decision to dress seven defenseman worked out when Marc Methot left after the first period with a lower-body injury and did not return. Boucher said after the game that Ottawa knew Methot was dealing with an issue, which is why the Senators used an extra defender. Suter scored late in the first and Ottawa continued to struggle in the second, leaving Anderson to keep the team in the game. He made huge saves on Nino Niederreiter and Erik Staal to keep it 1-0. The Senators had four power-play opportunities and struggled to create offense, a common refrain for the team as of late. The Wild made the Senators' power play look even worse when they scored short-handed. Staal got off a shot and Suter was there for the rebound. NOTES: LW Matt Puempel was a late healthy scratch for the Senators. Minnesota LW Zach Parise (lower body) missed his sixth straight game. C Joel Eriksson and D Nate Prosser were a healthy scratch. UP NEXT Wild: Host Calgary on Tuesday night. Senators: Play at Philadelphia on Tuesday night.  ",Ross A,Offence continues to sputter in 2-1 loss to Wild,"I donêt have much to say about this game. For the second time in as many games, the Senators were facing a backup goalie who hadnêt played in more than two weeks. And for the second time in two games, they had all sorts of trouble solving him. Unfortunately for Ottawa, this time they couldnêt eke out the victory. The Wild opened the scoring early with an awful shorthanded goal. The Sens lost the offensive zone draw, and then didnêt pressure Ryan Suter at all. Rather than just dump it, he skated it into the Sensê zone, passed to Eric Staal, and then potted the rebound because nobody had followed his movements, not even Craig Anderson. It was sloppy, sloppy work by a struggling powerplay.  The Wild nearly took a 2-0 lead late in the second period, but Mikko Koivuês stick, arms, and hockey pants were all above the crossbar when he made contact with the puck. The ref had signalled goal on the ice, but announced that the call on the ice stood and therefore it was no goal. The third period saw Ottawa tie it up with Kyle Turris shooting one through a Chris Neil screen. I donêt know why Neil was out with Turris, but in this instance, it worked. Ottawa just felt overwhelmed in overtime, and it ended with Matthew Dumba depositing a winner with just over a minute remaining, and with the Sensê corps looking exhausted. Minnesota were full marks for the victory, and Ottawa was probably happy to salvage a point after scoring just one goal for the seventh time in 15 games this season. Thing I donêt get: Line combinations Turris with Neil aside, there are some things I just donêt get. I know itês early to be throwing the coach under the bus (I gave Dave Cameron at least 30 games), but I do ask why Smith-Stone-Pageau is an inseparable line when this team is scoring 2.20 goals per game, good enough for 27th in the league. Weêve seen evidence that Hoffman-Turris-Stone is the best scoring line on the team. Dzingel-Brassard-Ryan were dangerous against the Canucks a while ago. Why not try those, rather than diluting offensive talent to the point this team canêt score goals? According to Natural Stat Trick, this team nearly broke even in shot attempts and shots this game, but did worse in terms of scoring chances (43%), and even worse in terms of high-danger chances (35%). It agrees with my eye test - the team is generating shots, but itês not generating chances. I know Iêm not an NHL coach, and I never will be, but I canêt help but think that loading up on offence is a good choice when your team has scored nine total goals in its last seven games.  ",Hockey Wilderness,"Dumba, Wild defeat Senators 2-1 in overtime","The Minnesota Wild donêt have a lot of positive experiences in the extra session to look back on. Maybe this will be one of them. Matt Dumba scored at 3:57 of the 3-on-3 overtime period to win the game and send the the Wild back home taking four out of a possible six points on the road trip out east. Minnesota was started the game undisciplined; taking three penalties in the first period alone. It was tough for the Wild to get much time in the offensive zone. After playing the night before, and then having to start a game short-handed because of of a few stick infractions, one would expect that the fatigue would set in early. There were only just a few good chances either side had. The best chance came when Charlie Coyle made a power move to the net and got a good shot off that trickled wide of the net guarded by Craig Andersen. Cool moment, that I didnêt know before: We all knew that Andersen has been playing with a heavy heart and an everyday struggle as his wife battles cancer. However, I didnêt know that when he pitched his shutout in Edmonton, the Edmonton faithful gave him a standing ovation, and Edmonton goalie Cam Talbot stayed out to congratulate him on his shutout and First Star selection for the game. He was overcome with emotion on the ice, and just writing about it now, itês tough not to have it pull at the heart strings. Very cool moment, and stick tap to the fans in Edmonton. Sorry, back to the game. The Wild eventually use their penalty for offense. After a defensive zone faceoff win, Ryan Suter skated the puck out of the zone. He made a pass to Eric Staal as soon as he cross the plane of the Ottawa line. Staal took a shot from the right circle, and Suter, whom was left unguarded by back-checking Senators, scored into the open net for a 1-0 lead.  Darcy Kuemper stopped all 13 shots he faced in the period. Outside of the Coyle play, and the Suter goal, there wasnêt much in terms of excitement for both teams. Minnesota came out of the locker room a better team. With hard forechecking and good shift after good shift, the Wild had come oh-so-close to scoring many times. With 15 shots on goal coming in the period, most of those chances came from the lines of Nino Niederreiter - Eric Staal - Charlie Coyle, and Mikael Granlund - Mikko Koivu - Jason Pominville.  The 22-12-3 line has been a dominant force both in possession, but in production as well, for quite a few games. They have everything you want in a line, size, skill, touch, and a bit of tenacity. We would be remiss, though, if we didnêt mention the way Mikael Granlund has played. He really seems to have liked his move to the wing. Heês battling in the corners and making mostly smart plays. His skates never stop moving, and he just looks like a better player, maybe his best since his becoming of a member of the Wild.  The Wild would take four straight penalties in the game before getting the benefit of a power play. Jason Zucker drew a slashing minor from Kyle Turris by attempting to skate forever in the Ottawa zone in possession of the puck. He is tied for second on the team with Koivu, Pominville, and Jonas Brodin with three penalties drawn, behind Staal and Coyle, who have five penalties drawn each.  The Wild would appear to score on the power play, but it looked like Koivu played the puck with a high stick. It was an odd series of events. It looked obvious in real-time that it was a high stick, however, the on-ice official pointed to signify a goal. The referee then made an announcement about it being not a goal because of a high stick. they then reviewed it with the Replay officials to confirm the call of _no-goal.Ó They got the call right, but it was odd that he first signaled goal, when it looked obvious in real-time. The teamês would open the third period with the same 1-0 score. It changed when Kyle Turris beat Kuemper to the blocker side to tie the game. Kuemper was playing really good to that point, though his rebound control was suspect all evening long. One of those juicy rebounds became the save of the game. The shot came in and caromed off his left pad right to a Senator. Kuemper loaded up on his right edge and pushed left with an out-stretched glove to make a phenomenal glove save. it was need too, as the Wild still were struggling to solve Andersen in the other cage. A number of chances seem to just trickle wide. Sixty minutes was not enough to find a winner in this game, and to overtime the teams went. The Wild have historically done awful in the 3-on-3 overtime period, and didnêt win in their only overtime game so far this season. Head coach Bruce Boudreau did a lot of mixing of speed, and seemed to use a new set of guys.   Thatês how it would end, because Mikael Granlund took it upon himself to dangle into the slot. After getting forced wide by the defense and Andersen, Granlund passed back into the slot for Matt Dumba, who had nothing but net for the game winner.  Shots were 42-36 and shots attempts were 49-46 both in favor of the Wild. For a team that started the road trip off a long layoff, this team has been shooting a bunch, and they were able to secure points in two of the three games. One pock mark on this team right now is the NHLês worst power play. If the Wild is looking to have success outside of St. Paul, that power play will need to improve immensely. This game against the Senators could have been won in regulation, but the Wild got just one shot on goal in two third period man-advantages. It simply isnêt good enough. Good thing the PK, which has shown signs of bending lately, is still very good.  "
16,1 Regular,11/15/2016,7:00 PM,A,Philadelphia Flyers,3,2,W,SO,10,5,1,W 1,26,6,0,2,0,35,4,0,4,0,"19,358",2:49,"karlsson 's shootout goal lifts Senators past Flyers, 3-2","Erik Karlsson showed again how valuable he is in a shootout. Karlsson scored the only goal of the tiebreaker to lift the Ottawa Senatorsto a 3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday night. After coming in with four goals in 12 shootout attempts, Karlsson snapped a wrist shot past Flyers goalie Steve Mason and inside the right post in the fifth round.  I'll be honest, when we got to the third shooter I was gonna put him in,  Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said.  But (Ryan) Dzingel is great in shootouts and (Mark) Stone had a great game. So after that, I said, `That's enough, let's send Erik.  Mark Stone and Kyle Turris scored in regulation for the Senators, who have won three of their last four while totaling seven regulation goals in that span. Craig Anderson had 33 saves through overtime and stopped all five Flyers attempts in the tiebreaker. Ottawa is now 10-5-1 even though it has scored two or fewer goals in regulation in 10 straight games.  You know, a good coaching staff, the right scouting and making sure we know what we are all doing so there is no confusion,  Anderson said.  For the most part, we have had very limited opportunities where we have made mental errors. We seem to be on the same page.  Nick Cousins and Michael Raffl had Philadelphia's goals, and Steve Mason finished with 24 saves. The Flyers went 0 for 4 on the power play and have lost four of five.  It's very disappointing but I think we battled hard,  Raffl said.  Even in overtime had a couple of chances and the shootout can go anyway. So that's a good point. But obviously, we're very disappointed with the loss.  Turris tied the score on a wraparound with 1:59 left in regulation as he swung around the right side of the net and beat Mason to the other side, stuffing the puck into the unguarded left side for his team-leading eight of the season.  I wanted to try and fake like I was going to bring it to the middle and get everyone to bite on it, so it would open up space for me on the far side,  said Turris, who had 13 goals in 57 games last season.  It opened up a lot of space.  In the closing minute of overtime, Karlsson and Turris passed the puck back and forth until both ran out of room on Mason.  Apparently, we didn't get a shot,  Boucher said.  It's yours, it's mine, it's yours, it's mine. We've had a lot of that.  The Flyers grabbed the early lead on Cousins' second goal of the season 5:14 in. An ill-advised neutral-zone pass by Ottawa's Derick Brassardlanded onto the stick of Cousins, who used a burst of speed to break free on Anderson. Cousins beat the goaltender past his stick side for his first goal since Oct 27 and 1-0 lead. The Senators tied it 7:09 into the second when they capitalized on a Flyers defensive zone turnover. Philadelphia's Jakub Voracek saw his pass intercepted and a poke check by Flyers defenseman Mark Streit ended up on the stick of Ottawa defenseman Mark Methot, who slid a centering pass to Stone for his third of the season and second in three games. The Flyers regained their lead a little more than six minutes later on Raffl's second goal of the season. Pierre-Edouard Bellemare beat Ottawa's Jean-Gabriel Pageau on a faceoff and Raffl converted Dale Weiss' rebound for his first goal since Oct. 15. NOTES: The Senators have not allowed a power-play goal in their last 11 games, killing off all 27 penalties in that stretch. ... With 11 games in 20 days, Flyers coach Dave Hakstol said before the game he would continue making day-of-game morning skates optional for his players. ... Senators LW Clark MacArthur, sidelined since Sept. 25 with a concussion, skated with a handful of teammates on Tuesday but remains on long-term injury reserve. ... Ottawa D Mark Methot was back in the lineup after leaving Sunday's game in the first period with a lower-body injury. UP NEXT Flyers: Host Winnipeg on Thursday night. Senators: Host Nashville on Thursday night.  ",nkb,Sens Top Flyers 3-2 in the Shootout,"There's been a lot of handwringing among Ottawa Senators fans and analysts lately on the topic of the team's inability to find the back of the net. Tonight's effort won't do much to quell those fears, but thanks to Craig Anderson the Sens again walked away with two points. There will come a time when scoring more than two goals to win a game is required of this team, but tonight was not that night. The Sens actually came out of the gates like a team possessed, hemming the Flyers in their end several times in the first few shifts. Philadelphia seemed flummoxed by Ottawa's extremely agressive pinching; on several occassions, Flyers defensemen attempting to break out up the strong side boards had their plays disrupted. Marc Methot and Mark Borowiecki, in particular, merit praise for their efforts in this regard. It was a shame then that the Flyers scored the first goal against the run of play after Derick Brassard committed a horrendous giveaway that led to a clean breakaway for Nick Cousins. On the TSN broadcast, I thought Ray Ferraro made an astute observation: the goal had nothing to do with Ottawa's system or style of play, it was simply an execution mistake. The Sens had been very successful up until that point by frenetically pressing in the offensive zone, and giving up an early goal should not have been cause to take their foot off the gas. The rest of the first period was mostly even as the Flyers recovered their footing, though I would give the edge to the Senators on the whole. They were good, and only two quality Steve Mason saves on semi-breakaways for both Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Ryan Dzingel kept the Flyers in the lead. The second period featured some sloppy hockey from both sides. Mark Stone would equalize just over seven minutes into the frame off of something of a broken play. It's worth noting that the chance itself only came about because of some deep pressure from Marc Methot. The Sens may not be finding the back of the net much these days, but it's hard to criticize them for not having a system and sticking to it -- their defensemen are constantly looking for opportunities to push down low and support the play. The sloppiness continued in the form of first Bobby Ryan, and then Erik Karlsson getting stripped of the puck at their own blue line. Karlsson was dispossessed by Travis Konecny, who was a menace all night for the Flyers, and only a solid Craig Anderson save bailed out the captain. That effort was for naught, however, as Michael Raffl scored almost immediately after the ensuing offensive zone face-off. Though the Sens had finally broken through Mason, this was their worst period of the night. The Flyers held a 31-16 shot attempt advantage in all situations in the second frae. The third period did not start well for Ottawa, as they first needed to kill off a Too Many Men on the Ice penalty before then almost immediately needing to survive a Pageau  gloving the puck on the face-off  penalty. The Flyers have possibly the best power play in the NHL, and the Sens making it through those two chances was a key juncture in the game. Nonetheless there was still the question of equalizing, and Ottawa made their fans wait until it was looking pretty grim before Kyle Turris' solo effort with under three minutes remaining knotted the score up. It was a bit of a strange goal, and a bit of a soft one if we're being honest here. But this is the kind of run the Sens are on right now: the bounces are mostly going their way. Overtime was a smorgasbord of chances for both sides, but will be mostly remembered for this completely failed 2 on 0 for Karlsson and Turris: Needless to say if no one was scoring on that chance, no one was scoring in overtime at all. Off to the shootout we headed, where the two goalies were once again the story. It took until the 10th attempt, Erik karlsson 's, before either was beaten and thus the Sens walked away with a 3-2 shootout victory. There was no clearly better side here tonight -- Ottawa acquitted itself very well in the first and third, but struggled badly in the second and took a few too many penalties throughout the game. A tie game through regular time was probably fair to both sides, and the Sens did well to earn the extra point. Let's just hope they find a way to get to just maybe three goals next game? I'm not asking for much, just three. NKB's 3 Quick thoughts: -Brassard has had a rough go of it to start the season, and it's now been 14 games without a goal for the Sens' biggest off-season acquisition. He's too good a player to go too much longer without potting one, but combined with Bobby ryan 's difficulties the Sens have two of their top six forwards completely MIA right now. Something's gotta give. -Our own Trevor Shackles had an article today on borowiecki 's improved play this season and his first few shifts in tonight's game were a great illustration of how his role in Guy boucher 's system is perfectly tailored to his skill-set. Boro is a good skater who lives for contact and by basically telling him to pinch on absolutely everything, he's being asked to do one of the things that he's actually good at over and over again. If Boro's going to keep afloat this year, he'll need to keep being successful on those pinches. -Besides his goal, I thought tonight was one of Mark stone 's best in terms of puck retrieval. Several times he simply picked the pocket of the Flyers skater and created several chances for the Sens in the process. Stone needs to score for this team to win, but he also needs to keep creating those chances and tonight he did that. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson At some point it'll get old to keep writing in Craig Anderson as the Sens' hero, but he really was fantastic again tonight. Sens Honourable Mention: Mark Stone Stone had one bad giveaway that forced Mike Hoffman to take a hooking penalty in the third, but besides that he was phenomenal. Sens Killer: Travis Konecny The Ottawa 67's alum was a menace all over the ice on this night, and only some strong work from Anderson kept him off the scoreboard.   ",Broad Street Hockey,Shootouts Are Evil,"After leading for most of the third period, the Flyers lost a 3-2 shootout decision to the Ottawa Senators in their first match-up of the season. While the Flyers appeared to be the better team for most of the night, a few key breakdowns gave the Senators enough of a chance to send the game to a shootout, where the Flyers met their fate. The Senators coming into this game were very much the anti-Flyers. They were very sound defensively, having allowed just 35 goals in their 15 games. However, their offense has not been good, and hadnêt scored more than twice in a game since October 25. Of course, the Flyers would have seemed to cured many teamês offensive woes this year, having conceded two or more goals in every game theyêve played this year. As is Hakstolês wont, the Flyers lineup did not change following Saturdayês win. The Senators did not have any significant injuries for tonightês game. After an uneven start, the Flyers would draw first blood. A neutral zone turnover from Derick Brassard eventually led to a 2-man breakaway with Brandon Manning joining the puck-carrying Nick Cousins into the offensive zone. Cousins was thinking shot all the way and wristed it by Anderson for the opening goal of the game at 5:14. The rest of the first period seemed emblematic of the Flyers season as whole. The Flyers ended up with a 10-9 shot advantage, but the more dangerous chances seem to come off Senatorsê sticks. Mason, unlike most of the starts heês had so far this season, was up to the task and stopped all shots in the period, including one set up by some local kid you may or may not have heard of, since heês from Cherry Hill and all...  A goaltender interference by said local native gave the Flyers the lone power play of the period, which carried over into the second. The Flyers wouldnêt convert the power play, but would carry most of the play early in the second. However, after some sloppy outlet passes in their own zone, Mark Stone was able to snipe one passed Mason from the slot to even the score at 1. The lead would last for about six minutes, until Raffl would stuff home a rebound from a Dale Weise shot. The play came off a Pierre-Edouard Bellemare faceoff win, and the Flyers were able to effectively work a preset play to recapture the lead at 13:18. The Senators would push back following the goal, as Mason foiled a Stone breakaway, and several dangerous Senators chances in the minutes immediately following the Raffl goal. The Flyers would settle things down with some good chances of their own, including one by Schenn that beat Anderson but missed the far post by inches, and for the second time in the contest the Flyers would carry over power play time into the next period. Shots in the second were 16-9 Flyers, and outside of a three minute window following the second Flyers goal, they were dominate in the period. The third period opened with several power plays for the Flyers. In addition to the carry-over penalty, the Senators were whistled for two more violations early in the third, but couldnêt get anything past an aggressive Senator PK and Anderson. Whenever you donêt convert that many power plays, an uneasiness tends to build in a close game since you can always point back to it and say they shouldêve buried them there. Although the Flyers played a good defensive period with the lead, Kyle Turris was able to catch Mason out of position on a wrap-around with just under two minutes left to tie the score. On replays it looked like Mason was expecting a pass instead of a shot, and Turris was able to convert fairly easily. Neither team really did anything of note after that, so it was off to overtime. Shots on the period were 8 apiece. The first few minutes of OT were uneventful, but a questionable non-call in the Ottawa end left Turris and Karlsson unopposed on Mason. But like Icarus, they flew too close to the sun and Mason was able to snuff out the opportunity until Giroux could get back to help out with the situation. Neither team was able to finish the deal in overtime, so they went to the ever-dreaded shootout. After five shootout attempts by the Flyers that can best be described as unimaginative, Erik Karlsson brought about the inevitable by beating Mason and ending the game in favor of the Senators. Other assorted observations: Nick Cousins was a force the first ten minutes of this game. In addition to the opening goal, he had several other chances that Anderson snuffed out. However, one can only do so much with the linemates he had this game, and wasnêt too much of a factor the rest of the game. Bursts like this, though, make a case for him to get in more games. As the first half of the game progressed, the game got more and more chippy, with several post-whistle skirmishes and boarder-line hits becoming commonplace. One such hit sent Matt Read to the locker room after getting thrown to the ice awkwardly by Mark Borowiecki. Some would say the refs butchered the call by not calling a penalty. Read would come back before the end of the second. Ottawaês powerplay came into tonightês game dead last in the NHL. After seeing their efforts in this game, itês not hard to see why as they had difficulty gaining the zone and sustaining any pressure against the Flyers PK, and even gave up some quality shorthanded chances. The Flyers power play, while producing several good chances, couldnêt convert on four chances. The Del Zotto-Ghostisbehere pairing may not be working out. While having both offensive defensemen on the ice at the same time may seem fun, they were caught being a bit too aggressive at times and it led to some dangerous chances against. Ivan Provorov seems to have settled down from his early-season jitters and played a solid, even if unspectacular game. The fancy plays will come later, but for now weêll gladly take a series of small, effective plays to help limit chances against and set up chances for the Flyers. It does appear thereês sawdust coming out of his mitts whenever heês got a chance to score, as evidenced by a 3-on-1 that he missed wide by a good margin late in the third. If youêre looking for razzle-dazzle, look no further than the other teenager on the Flyers, Travis Konecny. His speed is very evident whenever he is on the ice, and the defense must account for him at all times or he will be off and running. Some other areas of his game remain a bit raw, but itês hard to ask more of the 19-year old in his first 20 games of the year. Perhaps his biggest effect is on the second power play unit, which looks a lot more dangerous than previous years thanks in large part to his efforts. This game was another tough loss, where it can be argued the Flyers were the better team and didnêt get the deserved result. However, Mason continued to show some improvement making several difficult shots, and the offense continued to pepper the opposition with the majority of the shots. It can be a bit frustrating at times to see points left on the table, but with continued efforts like this, the wins will come eventually. We hope, at least.  "

Ryan Ellis scored the tiebreaking goal late in the first period, Pekka Rinnestopped 30 shots and the Predators beat the Senators 5-1 Thursday night. Mike Ribeiro had a goal and assist, and Colton Sissons, Pontus Aberg and James Neal also scored to help the Predators sweep the two-game series series against the Senators.  We played great,  Predators captain Mike Fisher said.  We've struggled on the road and this was a really good solid game for us. We needed that one. We did a lot of good things.  Before the game, Fisher was honored by the Senators for reaching the 1,000th game milestone last season. Fisher played 675 games with Ottawa before being traded to Nashville.  For the organization to do something like that was pretty special,  Fisher said.  There's so many great memories here, it's like home.  Derrick Brassard scored for Ottawa, and Mike Condon finished with 35 saves in his third start. The Senators haven't scored more than two goals in their last 11 games.  This is the second time we've been terrible against Nashville,  Senators coach Guy Boucher said.  I don't know if we're allergic to them or something.  Ellis beat Condon on the far side with about 4 1/2 minutes left in the opening period to put the Predators up 2-1.  Right off the bat our turnovers killed us in the first period,  Boucher said.  We're letting the opponent wear us down in the first period and then you play catch up hockey because of that.  I know guys are trying to get a bit more offense, but that's not the right way, that's definitely not the right way.  Nashville held the edge in play in the second and was rewarded as Aberg scored his first NHL goal, beating Condon through the legs with under three minutes remaining. The Senators were unable to create any real chances in the third despite two power plays. The Predators put the game out of reach as Neal, with his seventh goal in six games, and Ribeiro, taking a long pass from P.K. Subban, made it 5-1 sending the 15,480 fans at Canadian Tire Centre to the exits. Ottawa got off to a poor start, giving up the first goal for the sixth straight game.  It's always tough to play from behind,  Senators captain Erik Karlssonsaid.  We've been doing it a lot lately. ... We've got to come back and work on the things that we need to work on and realize we need a lot more, not a little bit more for Saturday's game.  The Predators opened the scoring at 2:14 as Sissons tipped Austin Watson's shot after some poor defensive coverage from Karlsson and Marc Methot. Brassard scored a power-play goal to tie the game at 8:36 of the first. It was just brassard 's second goal of the season and marked the Senators' first power-play goal in six games.  It's something I've been working on every day,  Brassard said of his shot.  I was working on it this morning. Now it's behind me and I have to focus on the next game and try and play well.  Ottawa's Bobby Ryan left the game with an upper body injury and did not return for the second period. NOTES: Prior to the game, the Senators honored Predators captain Mike Fisher for reaching the 1,000th game milestone last season. Fisher played 675 games with the Senators. ... Ottawa LW Mike Hoffman is out day-to-day and was replaced by Max McCormick. ... A late change had Andrew Hammond backing Condon up in place of Craig Anderson. ...

The Sens set out tonight to avenge that loss, but ended up faring even worse in a 5-1 loss. The Preds opened the scoring with Colton Sissons finding Austin Watson, then heading to the front of the net unnoticed and tipping in Watsonês pass while standing beside a surprised Marc Methot. The goal itself was a very nice tip, though it did seem the Sens fell asleep a little bit on defence. Ottawa would catch a break when Mike Fisher took a double-minor for high-sticking, giving their anemic powerplay four minutes to work with. It took almost three of those minutes, but they managed to score. Derick Brassard faked a pass from the circle, then snapped it in before Pekka Rinne had noticed. Gord Miller asked who needed that goal more - the Sens, their powerplay, or Brassard. It was a good question, but Iêm glad all three benefited. Unfortunately, Ottawa couldnêt make it out of the period tied. The Preds got the cycle going, and Mike Ribeiro managed to find the wide-open Ryan Ellis at the point. He ripped home a slapshot, and gave Nashville a 2-1 lead to end the first. The final shots were 17-7 for the Preds, which was pretty impressive considering Ottawa had the only powerplays of the period. The good news was the Sens had never been outshot for long in Guy Boucherês system, and so most figured the team would get that number back. There was a scary moment in the first for Sens equipment manager John Forget when he got hit over the eye with a puck. He needed stitches, but was back and all smiles to start the second. More noteworthy, Bobby Ryan took the puck to his hand on the Sensê powerplay. He went to the dressing room, returned, left again, and then announced he would not return for the rest of the game. With Mike Hoffman already out, losing the teamês other sniper was a big blow for Ottawa.  Turns out I was wrong. Nashville came out firing in the second and all Ottawa could do was hold on. The lone bright spot was Ottawaês penalty kill which had to step up twice. Ottawa had the worst powerplay Iêve seen in a long time, in which they got no shots, and Nashville had about four. It even ended with Mark Stone taking a slashing penalty. With about eight minutes left, Ottawa finally got some extended zone time. Credit where credit is due, the fourth line did a great job of working the puck around and causing mayhem for Karlsson and Methot to work with. That shift also featured the highlight of the game - Erik Karlsson leaping to glove down the puck and re-enter the Nashville zone after a high clear. The second highlight came just moments later, with Ryan Johansen sprung on a mini-breakaway. Condon came up strong with a save on Johansenês initial shot and rebound, and then holding the fort when James Neal came in to take whacks. The Sens took exception, and Chris Wideman of all people pushed Neal away from the net. Zack Smith ended up with the extra penalty from the scrum, but the Preds felt bad because they took a penalty eight seconds into their powerplay. With the period winding down, an uncovered pinch by Wideman set Nashville on a two-on-one, and Pontus Aberg fired home his first career goal. As it turned out, Smith had actually got the upper hand in that earlier scrum, because Neal lost his temper and threw Smith to the ice late in the period, giving the Sens a powerplay minus twenty seconds to open the third. I was hopeful entering the third, but that hope was dashed. To end things quickly: Nashville got two more goals. The first was on a beautiful cross-crease feed by P.K. Subban to James Neal who wasnêt going to miss an empty net, even if it was such a sharp angle. The second came when Mike Ribeiro somehow got a breakaway just as an Ottawa penalty was wrapping up, and fired home a blistering slapshot. And that did it for a game that the Sens never quite seemed ready for, one in which they were outshot 40-31, but at one point were down 26-9. Honourable Mention: Derick Brassard No heroes in such a lopsided loss, but Brassard gets noted for his goal, and for the confidence it inspired in him afterward. If Hoffman and/or Ryan are out long term, the Sens will need Brassard to remember his scoring touch. Honourable Mention: Mark Borowiecki I thought Boro looked good tonight a few times, at least when the game was still in reach, pinching at the right times, pressuring guys with the puck. He even took the puck from Subban at one point, which is no small feat. Sens Zero: Puck possession I donêt know what happened tonight, but the Sens fell asleep for 25 minutes spanning the first and second periods. At one point, the shots were tied 6-6. Then somehow Nashville got 20 of the next 23 shots in the game, and Ottawa looked like they were a major junior team. It wasnêt pretty. The thing is, even the best teams have games where they look lost (Pittsburgh losing 7-1, anyone?), so I canêt conclude from this game that the Sens are terrible. That being said, it was a little worrisome.  ",On the Forecheck,Response,"Colton Sissons opened the scoring on a pass to the net from Austin Watson created by Sissons' own dump in. The team needs a lot more of that. Mike Fisher took a double minor shortly thereafter, and while the Preds killed off the first two minutes, Derek Brassard tied it up on a shot that beat Pekka clean. The Predators controlled the rest of the period, including a shift with five shots on goal before Forsberg outworked all of Ottawa to feed Ellis for the 2-1 score. The second period started slow, as the teams traded powerplays that hampered momentum combined with a lot of disjointed play. The period began to pick up speed, until Pontus Abergnetted his first career goal. A desperate Senators team began to generate a bit of pressure until Neal flipped a player on his back to close out the period in the penalty box. The Predators killed off Neal's holding minor to begin the second period but the Senatorsê continued pressure drew another penalty from Aberg. The Predators managed to escape that unscathed, and James Neal tacks on an insurance goal to make it 4-1. Mike Ribeiro tacks on the 5-1 goal to cap off the offensive explosion. Random Observations The Preds get on the board first! Sissons! The Predators have the best home penalty kill, and the worst road PK. —At least they only scored one. Forsberg doing work leads to another goal. He's worth watching the entire game even when he isn't scoring himself. This period is fast, and I didn't notice until the announcers commented that there were no TV breaks until almost one minute left. Neal was just a little unhappy with Phaneuf and the refs. Four-on-four. Oh boy. Powerplay time! I thought Subban just blew a tire, but a nice clear by Rinne. This powerplay is doing a whole lot of nothing. Zero shots. Jarnkrok has a harder shot than I thought. Not taking penalties after sustained offensive zone pressure would be optimal. Condon was begging for a delay of game penalty on that idiotic play versus Austin Watson.  The Predatorsê powerplay is the definition of insanity right now. Iêm really liking this configuration of the fourth line. A lot more speed and offensive ability. The first sustained offensive zone pressure from Ottawa. Maybe donêt let them do that. What Iêm gathering from the Ottawa announcers is that Subban likes to spend most of his bench time talking to the other team. Pretty dangling play from Subban that ends in a Condon glove save. First career goal for Aberg!  Rinne, stop leaving the net. Itês not worth it. Ekholm lays on the ice a lot. I am not a fan of this play. Johansen should shoot more. Road frosties! I checked the rule book and it turns out Ribeiro is allowed to score goals. OTFês Super Duper Stars of the Game Pontus Aberg! Congrats on the goal and may he not be scratched again. James Neal: a goal in six straight games. Viktor Arvidsson because he deserves honorable mention in every game he plays.  "
18,1 Regular,11/19/2016,7:00 PM,,Florida Panthers,1,4,L,,10,7,1,L 2,40,0,0,2,0,23,4,0,0,0,"14,132",2:25,"Luongo makes 39 saves, Panthers beat Senators 4-1","Jaromir Jagr fueled the Florida Panthers on a strong offensive night. Still, the veteran forward was ready to credit this victory to his goaltender. Roberto Luongo made 39 saves to back a three-point effort by Jagr, helping the Panthers beat the Ottawa Senators 4-1 on Saturday night.  The score says we won 4-1,  Jagr said,  but Lou saved three or four goals at least, so we have to thank him.  Jagr had a goal and two assists, and Jussi Jokinen, Jonathan Marchessault and Derek MacKenzie also scored for the Panthers.  When we got our chances, we buried them, and sometimes that's all it takes,  Luongo said.  All in all, I made a couple of big saves, but the boys were able to take advantage of the opportunities and give me a little bit of breathing room.  Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored and Craig Anderson made 19 saves for the Senators, who have lost back-to-back games for just the second time this season.  We did a lot of good things, and we have to build off it,  Ottawa wing Chris Neil said, adding that  if you play like that, you're going to win more games than you're going to lose.  Pageau ended Luongo's shutout bid when his shot from below the goal line found its way between the netminder and the crossbar at 4:45 of the third period. Through 40 minutes, the Senators had nothing to show for two very solid periods of hockey, other than 27 shots on goal. At one point in the first, they held a 12-3 advantage in shots but trailed 2-0 after Jagr had a hand in on both goals. He opened the scoring 25 seconds in when his backhand shot was redirected by the stick of Senators forward Derick Brassard. Jagr then left the puck at the Ottawa blue line for Aleksander Barkov. He found Jokinen in the slot, and Jokinen beat Anderson high glove side with a wrist shot. Luongo got some help in the second period when Aaron Ekblad slid to block Mark stone 's shot after the original attempt by Brassard went off the end boards right to Stone at the side of the net. Luongo later stopped Pageau point blank with a sprawling save, then foiled Dzingel on a breakaway.  We were pretty lucky,  Jagr said.  It's nice to get a win but we were lucky and Lou played excellent and was unbelievable in the net.  Marchessault gave the Panthers a 3-0 lead at 14:55 of the second when a blocked shot went right to his stick at the side of the goal. He quickly swatted the puck past Anderson. MacKenzie scored for the Panthers at 9:16 when his shot barely got through Anderson and across the goal line. NOTES: Bobby Ryan, Mike Hoffman and Andrew Hammond were scratches for the Senators while Dylan McIlrath, Greg McKegg and Kyle Rau were scratches for the Panthers. ... Curtis Lazar was recalled by the Senators and made his season debut. ... The Senators placed goaltender Andrew Hammond on waivers. ... Panthers D Keith Yandle played in his 569th consecutive game. He currently ranks second in consecutive game played behind the 722 of Ducks F Andrew Cogliano. UP NEXT Panthers: At Madison Square Garden to face the New York Rangers on Sunday. Senators: Play Tuesday night in Montreal.  ",Ross A,Luongo earns 4-1 win for Panthers over Sens,"It doesnêt happen very often that you double an opponent in shots and they quadruple you in goals, but thatês exactly what happened tonight. Roberto Luongo was at his best, earning the Panthers a 4-1 win over the Senators despite a 40-23 shot advantage for the Sens. It looked like the Sens werenêt quite on time for the game start. It took just 25 seconds for the Panthers to open the scoring. Aleksander Barkov caught Mark Stone flat-footed at the Sensê blue-line and deked around him, Dion Phaneuf was suddenly defending a two-on-one, Barkov made the proper pass to Jaromir Jagr, and a back-rushing Derick Brassard tipped Jagrês shot past Craig Anderson. It seemed a pretty uncharacteristic start for the Sens, and as pointed out on the broadcast, it was the 13th time in 18 games the Sens allowed the first goal. From there, the Sens seemed to take over. The Sens got a bunch of shots, and drew the gameês first penalty when Ryan Dzingel accepted a gorgeous aerial pass from Marc Methot, and used his speed to race in on a partial breakaway. Despite a serious hook from Jakub Kindl, he still managed to hit the crossbar, but the lack of goal led to the penalty call. Ottawa dominated the powerplay, and then the next shift after the powerplay when they kept cycling and shooting but couldnêt score. The powerplay also featured Erik Karlsson going to the front of the net, then staying there for a good 20 seconds while the rest of the unit worked the perimeter.  From there, the game started to feel like when I play NHL Legacy, because just the third shot of the game for the Panthers went in too, a wrister from Jussi Jokinen. Somehow in a game the Sens were dominating, they were down 2-0. Ottawa would continue to run the balance of play in the first period, though Florida got some chances, but with Ottawa outshooting them 15-8.  The second period was more of the same. The Sens outshot the Cats 12-8, but Florida got the only goal of the period. Roberto Luongo made two more grade-A chances. First, Jean-Gabriel Pageau received a cross-crease pass on the powerplay and fired it on net, but somehow Bobby Lu did the splits to cover the goal line and batted it out of the air with his blocker. Second, Dzingel got a clear cut breakaway, but Luongo stayed with him the whole way and made a key save. Jonathan Marchesseault continued his hot start to the year, firing home his ninth goal. He showed all the signs of a player on fire, shooting home a one-timer just above the ice surface into the top corner after the puck fell from about 20 feet and bounced on the ice. The Sens finally found their way on the board in the third, with Pageau firing the puck in from behind the goal line, off Luongoês shoulder and into the net. It seemed fitting that the only way to beat him was from a shot that should never go in. The two-goal deficit would be short-lived though. Curtis Lazar hustled back to intercept the pass on what wouldêve been a two-on-one, but then whiffed on his attempt to knock the puck away after blocking it. Derek MacKenzie fired the stationary puck on net, and Andy half-saved, but it fell through his five-hold, and Lazar stopped the puck a couple inches past the goal line and swept it out. It was a tough break for Lazar in his first NHL game of the year. After two-and-a-half periods of pouring it on, that goal seemed to deflate the team. They just couldnêt find the same hustle, and seemed resigned to suffer back-to-back losses for just the second time this season. (Of course, a couple quick whistles in Luongoês favour may have also had a deflating effect.) And lose they did, by a final score of 4-1. Sens Hero: Jean-Gabriel Pageau Pageau got the long goal on a fluke chance, but also had a couple other chances that wouldêve been goals on most nights. Importantly, he had six shots on goal, and was looking like the dangerous offensive threat the Sens need him to be. Honourable Mention: Derick Brassard After scoring last game, he fired another seven shots on goal (and a few others just wide), and looked like a man determined to not go on another lengthy goal drought. If Hoffman and/or Ryan are out long term, the Sens will need that from him. Honourable Mention: Erik Karlsson I realized I almost never point him out in recaps anymore, mostly because heês always great. But just to point things out tonight - he played six minutes more than any other Sens player (27:50), was great defensively, wasnêt on for a goal allowed, and kept the puck in the offensive zone for what felt like minutes at a time. He truly is a great player that makes the Sens look dangerous every time he steps on the ice. Sens Killers: The grizzled veterans The Panthers have three players born in the 70s, and two of them dominated play tonight. Luongo allowed one fluke goal on 40 shots, and Jagr scored three points. Shawn Thornton? He had a decent scoring chance at one point, too.  ",Litter Box Cats,Jagr nets three points in Panthers 4-1 win over Senators,"On Saturday night in Canadian Tire Centre in Ottawa, the Florida Panthers defeated the Senators, 4-1.  After starting off their road trip with a rousing overtime victory against the Montreal Canadiens, 4-3 on Tuesday, the Panthers laid an egg on Thursday in the form of a 6-1 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs. This was a convincing return to form and once again gets the Panthers above .500 for the season (9-8-1).  Jaromir Jagr (2) ended his goal-scoring drought at 13 games with a score on the first shift of the game, with assists from Aleksander Barkov (7) and Keith Yandle (9). Yandle got things started with an outlet pass from deep in Floridaês own zone to Barkov, streaking in with Jagr in a two-on-one rush against Craig Anderson. Jagr backhanded it between Andersonês legs for a quick 1-0 Panthersê lead that they would never relinquish. Jussi Jokinen doubled Floridaês lead at the 12:00 mark with his first marker of the season, with helpers from Barkov (8) and Jagr (6). Jokinen went high on Andersonês glove side with a sneaky slow wrist shot from 12 feet in front of the crease to make it 2-0 on Floridaês third shot on goal of the game. The Sens had already challenged Roberto Luongo 10 times at that point. Jonathan Marchessault scored his team-leading ninth goal of the campaign with less than five minutes left in the second period when he roofed the biscuit past a confused looking Anderson for a 3-0 Panthersê lead. Jason Demers (6) and Vincent Trocheck (5) were credited with assists on the play. 4:45 into the final period would see the Senators break their seal when Jean-Gabriel Pageau made a physics defying shot to beat Luongo high on the glove side. Aside from good positioning, Luongo didnêt make a move to stop the puck. I donêt think he even saw it. In his defense, the shot was just impossible, and although legal, there oughta be a law. Just watch it if you havenêt. Kyle Turris (3) and Ryan Dzingel (5) got the assists on the goal, which turned out to be the only Ottawa score of the game. Luongo stopped 34-of-35 shots to earn the First Star of the Game.   Derek MacKenzie scored his second goal of the season halfway through the final period when he started an odd-man rush with tenacious defensive zone play and a shot that only a mother could love. After poke checking a pass out of the zone, Floridaês captain hustled down the ice just fast enough to get a pass off to Jussi Jokinen. Curtis Lazar intercepted the pass, but it bounced off his stick back to DMack, who slid it past Anderson. The Sens netminder stopped most of it, but it was just enough to cross the goal line for a 4-1 Florida lead. Jagr (7) was awarded his second assist of the night, and third point of the game on the play.   Turrists and Dzingelberries Special teams were almost a non-factor for both teams. Florida didnêt get a single power play, and the Senators were held to 0-for-2 for the game.  The Senators outshot the Panthers in every period, winning the shots-on-goal battle 15-to-8 in the first, 12-to-8 in the second, and 13-to-7 in the third.  In addition to getting 40 shots on goal to just 23 for the Panthers, Florida also managed to block 29 other shots to just 11 for the Sens for a 69-to-34 Fenwick in favor of Ottawa. Most of the advantage can be traced to score effects, as the Senators trailed for over 59 and a half minutes when it was all done. Mark Pysyk blocked a remarkable 12 shots all by himself. The Senators led Florida with 28 hits dished out, to 25 for the Panthers. MacKenzie and Kindl led the Cats with five each, while Aaron Ekblad dished out four. Pageau had a game-leading six for the Senators.  The three-point game was the 194th through Jagrês career, and his first since getting two goals and an assist in a 3-2 win over the Buffalo Sabres on October 15th last season. It was his 534th multi-point game, his 61st since turning 40.  The Panthers get a quick turnaround and visit the New York Rangers tomorrow night to close out the road trip. Join us back here for the GameThread and other refinements throughout the day. For another point of view on Saturdayês festivities, check out Ottawa Silver Seven.  "
19,1 Regular,11/22/2016,7:30 PM,A,Montreal Canadiens,4,3,W,,11,7,1,W 1,23,23,1,4,0,39,17,2,8,0,"21,288",2:45,"Stone, Karlsson score late to lift Sens over Canadiens 4-3","Erik Karlsson was relieved his Ottawa Senators piled on the goals for the first time in nearly a month. Ottawa scored more than twice in regulation time for the first time in its last 13 games as it downed the Montreal Canadiens 4-3 on Tuesday night. Karlsson scored the winner in the third period as the Sens came from behind to snap their two-game losing skid.  We did a good job, forechecking hard, capitalizing on turnovers,  said Karlsson, who reached the 400-point plateau with an assist in the second period.  When we got it, we found a way to put it in the back of the net with good shots. When we needed it, we put it in the net.  We had to make it as hard as we could for (Carey Price).  Montreal had three one-goal leads in the game but the Sens never fell further behind. Mark Stone tied it at 3 from the slot after three Canadiens players got caught behind their own net. Karlsson, the Sens captain, then broke the deadlock at 5:37, the visitors' first lead of the evening, on a fluke no-look shot from the blue line after a bad giveaway by Jeff Petry.  We bounced back every time they got one and that was a key part of the game,  said Mike Hoffman, who scored and had two assists.  Definitely an interesting game to be a part of, going back and forth. We haven't had too many of those this year.  It gives the whole group a boost of confidence when we get more than one or two goals.  Montreal played with five defensemen in the third period after Nathan Beaulieu left at the end of the second. Beaulieu took a shot from Derick Brassard to his neck and went straight to the dressing room. The Canadiens later confirmed Beaulieu was taken to the hospital for precautionary reasons. With Beaulieu's absence came extended ice times for Shea Weber (29:16) and Andrei Markov (30:43), Montreal's veteran defensemen. Coach Michel Therrien didn't have additional information on Beaulieu's injury after the game, though he admitted losing Beaulieu took a toll on his defense.  For sure when you're missing a guy like Nathan, who can play on the power play, on the penalty kill, it taxed our defensemen,  Therrien said.  But I thought they did a good job. Markov had a hell of a game. Weber the same thing.  After a sloppy first period by both teams, the goals came in quick succession in the second. Weber got the Habs on the board 56 seconds into the period with a thunderous slap shot from the point on the power play. Seven of Weber's eight goals scored this season have been scored with the man advantage. Weber also has seven of Montreal's 15 power-play goals. Five minutes later, with Ottawa on the power play, Hoffman beat Price above the shoulder from an extremely tight angle to make it 1-1. The Canadiens regained their lead at 7:29 when Alexander Radulovscored after an impressive effort. The Russian dangled around Hoffman along the boards, cut to the net, shot on Craig Anderson once then scored on his own rebound while falling to the ice. Brassard tied things 2-2 late in the second before Alex Galchenyukanswered back at 2:08 of the third. NOTES: Anderson made 36 saves while Price stopped 19 of 23 shots in defeat. ... The Sens conceded a power-play goal for the first time in their last 14 games. ... Markov had three assists. ... Charles Hudon and Greg Paterynwere healthy scratches for Montreal. Brian Flynn is still out with an upper-body injury. UP NEXT Senators: Host the Bruins on Thursday night. Canadiens: Host the Hurricanes on Thursday night.  ",Michaela Schreiter,Sens Find Much-Needed Offence in Win Over Habs,"The Ottawa Senators hoped to avoid their third loss in a row on Tuesday night against Carey Price the Montreal Canadiens. While the Habs came into the game having yet to lose in regulation at home, the Sens haven't experienced quite the same success as of late. And the prospect of standing up to the best goalie in the world is certainly no easy task, but it was one that the Sens were up for. 1st Period If the first period were a book, its title would be All the Penalties and No Goals (trademark pending). With a total of nine penalties and 24 PMs called in the first period alone, with no goals to show for it, it was a test of each team's penalty kill to say the least. The first one came early on in the game, as Mark Borowiecki was called for cross checking on Brendan Gallagher. However Montreal's power play wouldn't last long. Just one minute after borowiecki 's call, Alex Galchenyuk went to the box for tripping Zack Smith. Aside from a huge save by Craig Anderson on Paul Byron, who found himself all alone in front of the net, there weren't too many scoring chances on either side in each short-lived power play. When Ryan Dzingel found himself in the penalty box for interference on Alexei Emelin about halfway through the period, it was again Anderson who kept the Sens from giving up another power-play goal. He stood tall, including stopping a shot from Shea Weber. I think we can all agree he deserves some sort of award for making that look easy. The Sens' first decent scoring chance came from Ryan Dzingel, who broke into the offensive zone with (as always) impressive speed, only to be taken down by Jeff Petry. Petry would get called for interference, but the Sens once again came up short in their man advantage. Both Andrew Shaw and Chris Neil didn't think there were enough penalties in this period. So the two of them decided to get into a bit of a tussle after their respective minor calls. Of course, they both sat for fighting, and no one scored. With less than one minute remaining in the period, Mike Hoffman didn't want to be forgotten. He was called for travelling (throwing the puck) when he caught the puck in mid-air, and threw it into the offensive zone rather than dropping it down to himself. As a result, he finished the period in the penalty box. 2nd Period And of course, that's exactly where Hoffman would start the second. But unlike the first period, the lack of goals didn't continue into the second frame. Just 26 seconds in, Shea Weber let a bullet of a shot go from the point, beating Craig Anderson and opening up scoring for the Montreal Canadiens. This was Weber's 7th power-play goal of the season, and marked the 8th game in a row that Ottawa has given up the first goal. So this period was off to a great start. It felt like things could spiral out of control quickly for the Sens when Kyle Turris was called for tripping, just over a minute later. Luckily, the Sens' penalty kill was able to hold down the fort during this one, preventing the Canadiens from going up by two early on. But it didn't take too long for the Sens to respond. After Paul Byron went to the penalty box for hooking, Mike Hoffman would end his scoring slump with a short-side goal from the bottom of the circle. It's one thing to end a scoring drought with a goal that ties the game for your team, but to end it against Carey Price is also much-needed boost for Hoffman. Despite the relief that came with hoffman 's goal, the Sens weren't able to celebrate for long. Under two minutes later, Alexander Radulov broke into the Sens' zone, beating Hoffman before getting direct access to Craig Anderson, and scoring Montreal's second of the night. In a bizarre turn of events, the Sens tied up the game with just under five minutes left in the period. Mike Hoffman and Derick Brassard found themselves with a two-on-one opportunity. After Hoffman faked out the defender, he passed it to Brassard, who missed the original shot, but then attempted to slide the (very small) rebound past Carey Price. It appeared that Price stopped the rebound as well, and play continued. However, when the play finally stopped under a minute later, the save was reviewed, and it turns out the puck actually crossed the goal line. It may not have been pretty, but just like that, the Sens tied things up 2-2. The Sens would take another penalty before the second period came to an end, with Chris Neil getting called for unsportsmanlike conduct. Much like most of the penalties before this one, the Sens managed to at least finish the remainder of the period without allowing a goal. 3rd Period The third period didn't get off to a great start for the Sens. Within the first minute, captain Erik Karlsson was sent to the penalty box for tripping Paul Byron. On that very power play, Alex Galchenyuk gave Montreal the lead, sending a shot from the top of the circle into the net. Once again, Montreal had the lead. But not for long. Under a minute later, Mark Stone tied things up for Ottawa. After Erik Karlsson sent a high-flying puck into the Montreal's end, Derick Brassard picked it up behind the net, passed it to Mike Hoffman who quickly redirected it to Mark Stone. Stone made no mistake, tipping the puck into the back of the net and tying the game. This was no ordinary game-tying, third goal. This goal marked the first time that the Sens have scored three goals in regulation time, in 13 games! Much has been made about the Sens inability to score goals recently, but tonight the team didn't seem to have that problem. Maybe it's the prospect of playing against the best goalie in the game that gave the Sens some extra motivation. But regardless of the reason, it looks like their scoring troubles were put on hold for this game. The offence would continue for the Sens, as Erik Karlsson scored his fourth goal of the season, and 400th career point, just two minutes later. Karlsson sent the puck towards Montreal's net from the boards, and got some help from Jeff Petry's skate, which redirected it into the back of the net. The Sens met and exceeded the three-goal mark, and took the lead, with karlsson 's goal. Montreal would make it interesting near the end, in case this game wasn't already interesting enough, pulling Price and sending out the extra attacker. But Craig Anderson and Sens managed to hold them off, and got themselves a much-needed win in Montreal. This was Carey Price's first regulation loss of the season. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson It isn't too often that a goalie allows three goals in a game and gets the undisputed (in my opinion) hero of the game, but it was just that kind of night for Anderson. He stopped 36 of 39 shots from the Canadiens, and finished the game with a .923 SV%. But it was his timely saves that kept Ottawa in the game when they needed it most that made the difference tonight. Whether he was keeping the Sens out of trouble during the penalty kill, flashing leather on multiple occasions or not spontaniously combusting after standing in front of a shot from Shea Weber, Anderson deserves full credit for this win. Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman Much has been talked about regarding hoffman 's recent offensive troubles. But he certainly put all that talk to bed tonight, breaking his scoring slump (against Carey Price of all people), and picking up two helpers in the process. It seemed like Hoffman was all over the place tonight, ready to pounce on any scoring opportunity that came his way. Sens Hero: Mark Stone I feel like I'm handing out hero labels like candy tonight, but Stone had the exact same stats as Hoffman, and it was a little challenging to pick just one. Stone was just as much a part of this offensive burst from the Sens as Hoffman, with a goal and two assists on the night. It seems like when the Sens needed scoring most, their best players stepped up and got the job done. Honourable Mention: Derick Brassard His goal may have been a little awkward, but Brassard helped spark the very offence that the team has been starving for all season. He scored his second goal in three games, and deserves a shout out for playing a key role in jump starting his teammates in this game. Sens Killer: Shea Weber This may be the closest we've come to using the literal definition of killer on this site. Shea Weber's slap shot is nothing to joke about. The sheer thought of being anywhere near an ice surface when he winds up from the point is enough to keep most players awake at night. And tonight, he registered five shots on goal, a few of which were stopped by Anderson without a flinch. For scaring the daylights out of players, media and fans alike, Weber gets killer status tonight.  ",Eyes on the Prize,Price served his first regulation loss of the season,"In a division rivalry matchup, the Montreal Canadiens took to the Bell Centre ice to face off against the Ottawa Senators after two days off, looking for a win during their 20th game of the season. Though much noise had been made over the last couple of days about Torrey Mitchell centering Max Pacioretty and Andrew Shaw, the Canadiensê captain began the evening with two very familiar linemates, Brendan Gallagher and Tomas Plekanec. The first frame started out with subdued action at both ends of the ice, as each team felt the other out, but Mark Borowieckiês cross check on Gallagher in front of the Montreal bench would send the Habs to their first powerplay before four minutes could expire. But as the Canadiens had difficulties getting set up off the draw in the offensive zone and would need to clear and re-enter the zone, Alex Galchenyukês stick in Zack Smithês skates cut their man-advantage short just 60 seconds in. With man-advantages and scoring chances aplenty, the pace of the game began to pick up speed around the midway point of the first as adrenaline and emotions ran high. After Andrew Shaw and Chris Neil flew into the boards and exchanged pleasantries, the gloves quickly, and perhaps predictably, dropped to the ice. Though Shaw and Neil both managed a couple of jabs on the other, they mainly tangoed awkwardly all the way out to centre ice, where theyêd eventually be broken up and sent packing for seven minutes apiece. The Canadiens came flying out of the gates in the second, quickly gaining possession in the offensive zone. Markov teed up Shea Weber who stood waiting for his opportunity, and he made no mistake in blasting one past Anderson. But they werenêt yet finished. Much like the first, the second period was riddled with penalties, and Montreal found themselves with the man-advantage shortly after banking their first goal. The Habs were unsuccessful on this attempt, but received a number of good looks from Gallagher and Pacioretty. Again, much like in the first, Kyle Turris came in all alone on Price as he was released from the sin bin, who made the stick save to (briefly) maintain the Habsê lead. A Byron hook on Borowiecki a few moments later, and the Senators would even the playing field when Mike Hoffman fired the puck from down on one knee at the wing on his second attempt, giving the Ottawa the swing they needed to get back into the game. This was most definitely a game of equal opportunity, as Alex Radulov danced around the Ottawa D at the other end of the ice and would swing across the front of the net and throw the puck behind Craig Anderson to regain the Habsê lead. It was a glorious goal After another unsuccessful (but not uneventful) powerplay attempt for the Canadiens, Nathan Beaulieu went down on a play where the puck deflected off his stick and to his neck. Beaulieu would struggle make his way off the ice and would not return for the remainder of the game, being escorted via ambulance to the hospital for treatment. Back in the Canadiens zone, Hoffman dangled his way past the Tricoloreês defense to swing a shot toward Price and his rebounded was swatted at by Brassard, whose attempts were ruled a good goal following a TV timeout to review the play. And just like that, we had a tie game once again! The waning minutes of the second frame ticked away like much of the first; end to end action that would result in puck covering and net-front scrums on both Price and Andersonês behalf. Chris Neil earned himself two minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct in the dying minutes of the period, but the Habs would not be able to convert before time expired. The Canadiens failed to get anything going with less than 10 seconds of the powerplay remaining in the opening of the third period, but they wouldnêt need to worry for too long, as Erik Karlsson would be sent to the box on a tripping call just 58 seconds into the period. Radulov sent a cross-ice pass to Galchenyuk, whose rocket of a shot was stopped by Anderson, but when the Canadiens regained the puck off the rebound and Radulov eventually served Chucky an almost identical pass, #27 would make no mistake for his 8th of the season, giving his team the lead early in the third. A story of short-lived victories, the Senators went on to tie the game up yet again just over a minute later when a centered pass from Hoffman to Stone zipped by Price, with three of his teammates behind the goal line and well behind the play. Two minutes later, Karlsson gave his team the go-ahead goal when a soft shot from the boards snuck by the leg of Price, who was screened on the shot by Pageau and Petry.  The remainder of the game would be spent at both ends of the ice with several dangerous chances put up against each goaltender, but theyêd both remain solid. Despite a valiant push from Montrealês rolling lines, their 6-on-5 attempt wasnêt enough to tie things up for overtime as a last second hammer shot from Weber was fired wide, and time expired before they could make a move on the rebound. Pacioretty and Dion Phaneuf came together in a bit of a tussle, but in the end, Ottawa skated away with the win handing Montreal their first regulation loss on home ice, and Priceês first regulation loss of the year.  Thoughts Though goals and penalties were exchanged back and forth for the entire game, the Canadiens never really sat back on a lead or stopped pressing. They kept coming shift after shit, regardless of the score. Joel Hanley didnêt get very much ice time before Beaulieuês injury, but you also need to consider the fact that the Canadiens were on the powerplay or penalty kill every few minutes in those first two periods    both special teams where he may not see a whole lot of action. Despite post-practice interviews, it seems like Pacioretty is slipping back into his skin. He was all over the ice last night, and looked particularly dangerous with linemate Gallagher. Both were relentless and both came within a few inches of a goal on more than one occasion. Gallagher is frustrated, but if he continues to put in this level of effort, the goals will certainly come. The Canadiens will skate on home ice once again to square off against the Carolina Hurricanes on Thursday, who will roll into town 5-0 in their last five games, including a 3-2 win over the Habs last week. This will mark the final home game before they embark on a five game Western Conference road trip. "

Chris Wideman and Kyle Turris scored in the third to help the Senators beat the Bruins 3-1 on Thursday night. Mark Stone tied it in the second period, and Craig Anderson made 19 saves.  We're becoming a more resilient group, a more veteran group where we don't play to the scoreboard, we just play our way, the way we're supposed to whether we're up a goal or down a goal,  Anderson said.  I think we've grown here since the start of the year.  The Senators were coming off a 4-3 victory at NHL-leading Montreal on Tuesday night. Before producing seven goals in their last six periods, the Senators had struggled to score 12 goals in their nine previous games.  Huge win for us,  Turris said.  We just have to keep the momentum going now. We're playing we. We played real strong defensively and in the neutral zone. It was just an all-around solid game for us.  David Pastrnak scored for Boston, and Tuukka Rask stopped 23 shots.  I think the whole game there was poor puck management in my estimation,  Bruins coach Claude Julien said.  We've been a better team than that. It's disappointing tonight in an important game like this we came out with one of worst efforts in probably a month,  Julien said.  I didn't like our game tonight, decision making, puck management, I would say there were a lot of no shows, as well. Those are things that can't happen in these kind of games. Definitely not happy with not just the outcome, but our team. Definitely we need to be better.  Wideman scored at 6:28 of the third. After Rask made a save off Derick Brassard, Torey Krug tried to clear the puck, but he put it right onto the stick of Wideman, whose shot bounced off Bruins defenseman Dominic Moore in front of Rask and in. Turris scored at 10:16, taking a pass from Bobby Ryan and beating Rask on a breakaway. NOTES: The Senators improved to 12-7-1, and the Bruins dropped to 11-9-0. ... Ottawa scratched Fredrik Claesson and Max McCormick, and Colin Miller, Zdeno Chara and Anton Khudobin sat out for Boston. ... The Senators have scored the first goal just five times in 20 games this season. UP NEXT Bruins: Return home to face Calgary on Friday night. Senators: Host Carolina on Saturday night.  ",Ary M,"Stone, Senators stifle Bruins; win 3 - 1","Heading into the week, if you wouldêve told me that the Ottawa Senators would score 3+ goals on both Carey Price and Tuukka Rask, I donêt know if I wouldêve believed you (well.. maybe on Price). Itês almost like the Sens were too good to continue scoring 2 goals a game! However, I donêt think that was the major story of the night. Instead, it was the fact that the team that struggled so much during close games last year kept a decent Bruins squad to just 1 goal on 20 shots.  Coming into tonight, the Bruins were surprising some folks. For a team that missed the playoffs on the last game of the regular season courtesy of a 6-1 loss to your Ottawa Senators and had spent a good portion of the next few months deciding whether to fire the winningest coach in their history, the Bruins werenêt supposed to be good. Zdeno Chara   who didnêt play tonight after being injured against St. Louis   was getting older, and their recent free agent signings, Matt Beleskey and David Backes, were struggling offensively. However, the team boasted some of the top shot and goal metrics in the league.  What did the Sens do? They played a tight checking game, especially through the neutral zone, and held Boston to just 34 shot attempts, 1 high-danger scoring chance, and 0.5 expected goals. It was a remarkable defensive performance.  The game didnêt start that way, as the Senators surrendered the first goal again in the last minute of the first period thanks to David Pastrnakês team leading 11th goal in 15 games. After Chris Neil took a silly interference penalty, the Bruins circled the puck around until Brad Marchand was able to get a shot through that gave Craig Anderson some trouble, largely due to the traffic in front. Beleskey then shovelled the puck to Pastrnak, who had a open cage to pot the Senatorsê third powerplay goal against in their last two games. The game slowed down a lot in the second, a period with only 21 shot attempts total. Neither team was generating much of anything until Chris Wideman and Brad Marchand took coinciding minor penalties, which led to an extended stretch of 4-on-4 and post-penalty action where there were no whistles. Soon after, the Hoffman - Brassard - Stone line took advantage by creating an odd-man situation via a poor Bruins (long) change.  As Dion Phaneuf notices the Bruins changing at the top of the screen, he quickly passes the puck up the left wall and past the check of the Bruins RWer.   The left winger who receives the puck is Mike Hoffman, who immediately looks across the ice to spot Mark Stone through the middle. Now, Stone isnêt the fleetest of foot, but the playês already _overÓ at this point given that a) the Bruins RWer was beat by Phaneufês pass, b) the Bruins left winger just got onto the ice, c) the centre is _in positionÓ but not relevant in this scenario, and most importantly, d) the Bruins D were way too aggressive at their blueline. Essentially the D are stuck in no-mans land: too far away from Mike Hoffman to close the gap in time on the entry, and caught flat footed against Mark Stone, who has a gap in the middle.  Looking at the time, this all happens in two seconds. But you can see the end result in sight. Whatês not to be understated is the beautiful move Stone makes around Tuukka Rask, who can see this play developing from a mile away but is left powerless to stop it. Watch it in its fully glory below.  After two periods of play, the shots were 14 - 13 Ottawa, 5-on-5 attempts were tied at 25 a piece, and scoring chances were 6 - 5 in favour of the Bruins, but 2 - 1 in favour of Ottawa in terms of high-danger. All in all, an even game that deserved to be tied heading into the third period.  What was most impressive was how Ottawa played in the third period. After Curtis Lazar drew a penalty against Ryan Spooner two minutes in, the Sens generated a number of quality chances, with Brassard and Karlsson narrowly missing opportunities. It continued afterwards, too, and on some strong offensive zone play by Hoffman - Brassard - Stone, Chris Wideman was the beneficiary of a lucky bounce by scoring the first of the year just trying to get an attempt on net. Itês a lucky deflection off the knee of Dominic Moore, but for Wideman, it must feel good. The third-year NHLer is coming off of a recent injury and is expected to contribute more offensively, so hopefully this goal serves as a pick-me-up to give him confidence to generate more offensively.  Shortly after, the Sens take advantage of a poor Krejci pass in the high slot that Kyle Turrispicks off. He races into the offensive zone on the left wing, drops a pass to Bobby Ryan, and heads to the net. Itês Ryan who makes this play special, despite his hand injury, as he looks shot (or pass to an onrushing Cody Ceci) the whole way but slips the puck straight to Turris, who elevates it beautifully past Tuukka Rask for the teamês third goal. Iêll give credit where creditês due and point out that Turris ended up with so much room partly due to Cody Ceci taking up Torey Krugês attention on the right side. Overall, Ceci had one of his stronger games of the season and was the teamês leading shot attempt driver on defence while being on the ice for two goals in his 19:45 of ice-time.  Sens Hero: Guy Boucher An unconventional choice, but Boucherês defensive systems were on full display tonight. The Sens consistently blocked lanes, stifled the Bruins at 5-on-5, and Çwonê the matchup game tonight. Over at HockeyViz, which you can support here, Micahês created a cool graphic that displays matchups by ice-time, possession, and pace. The bigger the square, the more ice-time player X played against player Y. Here, the more Çredê the box, the more the Bruins dominated that matchup while X was on the ice; vice-versa for blue. The visual helps us see that Smith - Pageau - Pyatt; Methot - Karlsson were basically sacrificed to keep the Bruins top line of Pastrnak - Bergeron - Marchand off the board tonight and did a good job of keeping the chances minimal despite losing the shot attempt battle. This freed the other lines up, especially Dzingel - Turris - Ryan, to dictate play against the rest of the Bruins forwards, and with 55% of the attempts at 5-on-5 tonight, Boucherês bet paid off against what was a strong team coming in. Taken together with the mid-game injury to Ryan Dzingel, who took a misdirected puck to the ear early on but returned late in the second, and Hoffman/Ryan/Phaneufês general soreness, Boucher had to manage his bench and did so successfully tonight.  ",Stanley Cup of Chowder,"Bruins struggle in the neutral zone, fall to Senators 3-1","This game started off with good intentions - a team parallel to the Bruins in the standings with a strong goalie but shuffled forward lines and uncertain offensive prowess. One would hope that even a defense without captain and top defenseman Zdeno Chara could push back enough to slow down the Senators' forwards. With the return of David Pastrnak, the Bruins offense seemed potent enough to overpower Ottawa's scoring. Did you watch the game? Rank the Bruins' players. First Period It was evident that the Bruins were struggling to clear their zone from early in this game. Passes weren't connecting, and with the defense constantly on their heels, Ottawa was able to hold an offensive zone time advantage. Fortunately for the Bruins, the offensive energy that Ottawa sustained was negated by a late penalty to Chris Neil and the Bruins capitalized, owning the final minute of the frame and scoring off some great awareness by His Carbiness David Pastrnak. Second Period If you noticed the lugnuts wiggling a little bit in the first period, you saw the wheels come off in the second. There was significant pressure from Ottawa immediately and it showed first in tenacious faceoff wins by Turris, Pageau and Brassard. The shots that were landing on Senators goalie Craig Anderson were easily handled and, while registering some early shots on the scoresheet, none were a serious challenge for the netminder. Meanwhile, Ottawa began countering with continued pressure and it worked.  A great lead pass from Mike Hoffman to Mark Stone tied the game. Fortunately, this game was tied going into the second intermission. Third Period The frustration mounted for the Bruins, manifesting in an early penalty from Ryan Spooner and some panicked clearing attempts by the Bruins defense. In a collapsing scramble in front of Tuukka Rask, defenseman Torey Krug tried to clear a loose puck and it landed right in Chris Wideman's wheelhouse. This would put the Senators ahead for good, as Kyle Turris followed with another strike at the halfway point of the third, putting this game out of reach for the backsliding Bruins.  It's hard not to fault the defense for this, because there were wide open passing lanes for the Senators to play with. The forwards did string together some strong offensive zone time, but it was for a shift or two at the most, without truly applying sustained pressure. The real challenge was gaining the offensive zone - several offsides calls, for example, or a defender not getting enough on a pass - and it showed in the meager shot attempts by Boston. Couple that with a team-wide poor showing in the faceoff dot and the possession game was just plain weak. On to Calgary, where there's some hope for a rebound win.  "
21,1 Regular,11/26/2016,7:00 PM,,Carolina Hurricanes,2,1,W,,13,7,1,W 3,24,2,0,1,0,33,2,0,1,0,"18,042",2:26,"Turris scores 10th goal, Senators beat Hurricanes 2-1","The Ottawa Senators found another way to win a close game -- at the Carolina Hurricanes' expense. Kyle Turris scored his team-leading 10th goal to help Ottawa beat Carolina 2-1 on Saturday night. Turris broke a tie with 3:32 left, beating goalie Cam Ward high to the stick side. The Hurricanes challenged the goal, asserting that it was offside, but it stood after a review. Dion Phaneuf also scored, and Craig Anderson made 32 saves. The Senators have won three straight to improve to 13-7-1. They are 9-1-1 in one-goal games.  I think we believe in the way that we play,  Phaneuf said.  When we play that way we don't give up a lot and when you don't give up a lot you're going to be in a lot of tight games. We found a way to stick around, found a way to come back and found a way to play tight games and the bottom line is we continue to stick with our game and again (Saturday) we come through with winning it late and they're big points. It might be early, but they're big points.  Sebastian Aho scored for Carolina, and Ward stopped 22 shots.  The effort was good,  Carolina coach Bill Peters said.  You can't fault the effort. It's not frustrating. It's reality. They won 2-1 so we have to find a way to score. You have to get to three in this league, typically. Three is the number. We didn't do that in either of our last two games. We have to find a way to score more.  Phaneuf tied it at 1 at 6:15 of the second with his second goal of the season. Ryan Dzingel did some great work, was patient and found Phaneuf who stepped into the slot and buried it past Ward. For the 11th straight game Ottawa gave up the first goal. Carolina opened the scoring at 11:24 of the first. Aho put a shot on goal, Anderson made the stop and the rebound went in off Ottawa's Tom Pyatt.  I don't know how many games it is that we've given up the first goal and it makes absolutely no difference to us,  Senators coach Guy Boucher said.  We expect tight games, we're going to be good in tight games and I know it was an issue last year, but I wasn't here, but I know as a team there were things to change and that was one of them.  It's a mental approach and players have really grown. There's no panic on the bench, there's no panic when the other team scores first, no panic if we take a penalty or we miss some chances.  NOTES: Carolina was 1-2 on its three-game trip. ... Erik Karlsson played his 500th NHL game, all with the Senators. UP NEXT: Hurricanes: Return home to face Florida on Sunday night. Senators: At New York Rangers on Sunday night.  ",Ross A,Anderson leads Sens to third-straight victory,"It was yet another spectacular win for Craig Anderson. I could probably write that to open half the recaps of the season. The Senators were outshot 33-24, but somehow came out with a 2-1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes. Even the only goal he allowed was put in by his own defenceman, so itês impossible to fault him for it. It was Erik Karlssonês 500th game, and he responded by struggling against the Rask-Teravainen-Lindholm line all night. Seriously, that Canes crew got more than 70% of the 5v5 shot attempts in the 10 minutes they played against Karlsson. But even the captain is allowed an off night, and hey, he assisted on the game-winner. Sebastian Aho got credited with the first goal of the game. Anderson made the save, but Tom Pyatt accidentally deflected the rebound in. It was the 16th time this season the Sens allowed the first goal. Dion Phaneuf tied it up in the second. After getting the puck from Ryan Dzingel at the point, he deked around Aho and fired a gorgeous shot past Cam Ward. It was a sweet set of moves from Phaneuf, one that was reminiscent of his highlight reels from early in his career. The game-winner came with only three minutes left in the game. Kyle Turris and Bobby Ryanhad a sweet little give-and-go to enter the zone, with Turris putting the shot in past Ward, over a diving Jaccob Slavin. The Canes would challenge for offside, but Turris had just barely kept himself onside. These last two games have left me wondering why the Turris-Ryan combo that was so successful in Bobbyês first year in Ottawa never seemed to happen again. They seem to have beautiful scoring chemistry.  The Canes would pull their goalie and pile on the shots, but Andy was there when needed. Donêt look now, but Ottawaês on a three-game winning streak! Sens Hero: Craig Anderson ÇNuff said. Honourable Mention: Dion Phaneuf That goal was a thing of beauty, something I never expected to see out of Phaneuf in a Sens uniform. Not to mention he was only behind Karlsson by 2:15 in time-on-ice tonight. Thatêll be helpful for Ottawaês success down the stretch if Karlsson doesnêt have to play 30 minutes every game.  ",Canes Country,Hurricanes Stumble in Ottawa,"The Carolina Hurricanesê previous five-game winning streak has given way to a two-game losing streak, and the familiar sting of losing by one goal is creeping back after last nightês game in Ottawa.  The Canes started well, with a strange bounce leading to a goal for Sebastian Aho, but that was all the production offense would create. From there, all puck luck left the building for the team in white, and noted Cane-killer Kyle Turris struck again to crush the spirits of the Carolina faithful. Most worrisome, though, was the fact that a few negative trends continued for the Hurricanes last night.                                          Talking Points Offense falters again, but Ward keeps it close What began as a strong asset for the Hurricanes this season has reverted to being their current pitfall. While they averaged 2.8 goals/game over their five-game win streak, the team has now posted just one goal in each of their past two games.  The worst side of this is that the Hurricanes are still getting the same solid goaltending from Cam Ward (#ForNow) that they got during their win streak, but lack of productivity in the offensive zone is ironically the cost of their newfound losing streak. Ward has not given up more than two goals since November 10 against Anaheim when he let in three, and has averaged a .949 save % over that span, including a .929 % over the past three games (TOR, MTL, OTT). Itês only a two game slide, but the Hurricanes would be wise to not waste such a long string of impressive performances from their veteran goalie. After all, who knows how long his play will last? Ideally, this is a revitalized Ward who has rediscovered the spark that made him a #1 goalie to begin with, but without the goal cushion he was receiving from the team in front of him last week, it will be interesting to see if his game changes at all.  The bottom line is, scoring one goal in a game is not a great way to win a game in the NHL. Sure, they beat San Jose 1-0 last week, but that game was far from the norm. If the Hurricanes want to win consistently as in, playoff-level consistency they need to start putting multiple goals on the board on a regular basis again, or risk letting this low-scoring style become a bad habit.  Third period woes continue As Tripp Tracy noted multiple times last evening, the Thanksgiving night loss to Montreal marked the first time that Carolina had lost the third period since falling to New Jersey in a shootout back on November 8th. That is to say, the Hurricanes had either had more or equal third period scoring than/as their opponents for two weeks (six games) before giving up the game winner to Max Pacioretty the other night in Montreal.  Regrettably, the same movie was showing in Ottawa last night. And while Carolina did not play particularly bad in the third period of either of the past two losses, their physical and mental fortitude exhibited at the ends of their wins last week was simply not present. Take a look at Turrisê game winner. Iêm no expert, but I do know that Assistant Coach Steve Smithês defensive strategy for the young core does not include getting walked around at their own blue line. In fact, most of the time, they are encouraged to step up and make a play to push the player to the outside, which definitely does not occur.  This goal at any other point in the game is not nearly as backbreaking, but here, with just over three minutes left in the game, and your best defensive pairing on the ice, giving up a goal like this is absolutely gutting for a Carolina player or fan.  Whatês most perplexing about this goal in particular is that Jaccob Slavin and Brett Pesce are both in really good position as Turris is about to enter the zone. Iêm not sure if Slavin fails to anticipate Turrisê speed or if he thought he would dish the puck off, but he gets caught flat-footed in a big way. And Pesce, because he was well-positioned to cover the passing option on the wing, cannot get over in time to help out his partner.  Now, the silver lining is that this play is not a trend for either of these two defensemen. More than likely, they were tired and lost focus for a second or two. But those two seconds cost them last night, just like how two seconds of lost focus cost the team in Montreal. And the difference between this week and last week has been Carolinaês consistent focus throughout all 60 minutes of the game at home and in Toronto, but lack thereof in the two games since.  In the tight games that the Hurricanes often find themselves in, they cannot afford these brief lapses in concentration. As they have now seen, it can and will cost them two points in the standings. They need to regain the aforementioned fortitude, which starts with their leaders. It will be interesting to see if the four designated captains (and others who may not wear letters) can step up and help keep the team on track.                                           Moral of the Story In a game that Carolina probably should have won, losing can often cloud the positives. For example, Cam Ward continued to be the reason the Hurricanes remained competitive instead of the reason they were losing, and hey, Sebastian Aho scored his third goal of the season.  Sure, it was a fluky deflection that was mostly luck, but the young Finn is still looking dangerous with the puck on his stick anywhere in the offensive zone. His vision created that play for him, and the fact that he got credit for the goal was just an added bonus.  But the most important positive lies in the fact that the team continued doing many of the things that have made them successful thus far. They entered the offensive zone as a line with the puck instead of dumping it in, the defensemen skated up the ice when the passing lanes were closed instead of going for home-run stretch passes, and their penalty-kill (I know, they only had to kill one penalty, but the point remains) was still stifling.  So yeah, the loss may be the second in as many games, and they may have continued some negative trends, but the teamês identity is still there. And as long as they have an identity, they have a chance to win. Next up is Florida tonight at PNC Arena, and itês a safe bet the Hurricanes will be eager to get the sour taste of last night out of their mouths with a big win at home.  "

It also improved to 3-0 in the second night of back-to-back sets. ""To have to play here back to back on the road and get a team that's been firing from all cylinders,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said.

There were a lot of factors against them: playing the same goaltender on the second-half of a back-to-back, versus a high-pace, high-scoring Rangers team, with a number of players reportedly battling injuries.  However, despite losing the shot battle for the second straight night (33 - 20), the Sens kept the Rangers in-check for most of the game. They finished with ~46% of the shot attempts and held the blueshirts to 10 scoring chances at 5-on-5. The Sens started strong as the sharper of the two teams, rushing out to 4-2 lead in shots and getting a couple of scoring chances off the sticks of Erik Karlsson and Tom Pyatt. However, the Rangers Çwonê the period with their latter half   finding their mojo and setting up in the Senators zone with relative consistency. They were emboldened after two strong powerplays where Michael Grabner and Rick Nash just missed tap-ins for goals.  Much like the first, the Sens started the second strong and this time, they got rewarded for it. You can see the goal pretty clearly in the two frames below. First, Zack Smith picks off a failed Rangers zone exit at the left side boards and gets the puck to Tom Pyatt behind the net (his favourite spot). At this point, you can see Pageau skating through the slot but checked by both a Rangers forward and Kevin Klein on D. However, as both Klein and the forward collapse on Pyatt, the ex-Rags forward manages to hit the now open Pageau with a quick pass.   #44 doesnêt waste any time potting the one-timer past Antti Raanta   who was in net tonight to give Henrik Lundqvist a rest. The bulk of the second period was mostly played to an even standstill, with neither team not generating much at 5-on-5 in terms of shots towards the net. Given both the back-to-back and the fact that the Rangers are a high-pace team, the fact that the Rangers were offensively challenged in the period is a Çwinê for the Senators as it means that they were forcing the Rags to play Çtheir wayê. The team did take two more penalties, with Dion Phaneuf and Zack Smith taking slashing penalties, but the Erik Karlsson-led Sens group managed to kill both off.  In fact, it was the Sens (!) who scored the lone powerplay goal of the game. With the Sens having trouble setting up, the Rangers got unlucky and had their attempted clear hit the back of the referee, leaving Mike Hoffman to pick up the loose puck. Instead of sending it low to Kyle Turris along the left half-boards, Hoffman draws two Rangers PKers in and slides the puck to Mark Stone in the left slot, who goes short side past Raanta to give the Sens a 2 - 0 lead. Although Iêd say that, as a whole, the Sens PP unit struggled again tonight -- thereês a part of me hoping that lucky bounces such as this one will give the group some added confidence that they can build off of next time theyêre out there. With 5 goals in his last nine games, itês safe to say that Mark Stone is fully healed and playing like his old self after missing most of training camp and being on the receiving end of some hard bumps and bruises in October.  In the third, the Senators got a bit away from their gameplan and played the Rangers at a much higher pace than they did the rest of the game. This is evident in the shot attempt numbers, as the 43 overall in the third only a little less than half of the 91 the game had in total. When the play picked up, Hoffman - Brassard - Stone were able to keep up and dictate play while on the flipside, the fourth line of Lazar - Kelly - Neil struggled mightily. At different points of the period, Marc Methot, Mark Borowiecki, and Chris Wideman all prevented tap-in goals by the Rangers either through a blocked shot, pass, or a goal-line clear. By now, the Sens collapsing to the middle of the ice to prevent chances in close is something weêre used to and it was certainly evident tonight.  Sens Hero: Craig Anderson When your goalie stops 64 of the 65 shots he faced this weekend and has the confidence to go for an empty net goal, you bet that heês a hero. If youêre down to wait for the advertisement, his three best saves can be found below: In his pre-game interview, Boucher noted that he wasnêt sure he was going to play Anderson tonight, but decided to go with him after the Çtender said he still had a lot of energy. Of interest was the nugget that Anderson will likely be going on leave for a Çcouple of gamesê shortly, meaning that Andrew Hammond will find himself back with the Senators soon. Itês going to be hard for him to leave after winning four straight.    ",Blue Shirt Banter,Rangers Come Up Empty Against Ottawa Senators,"After Fridayês win over the Philadelphia Flyers, the New York Rangers followed it up with an extremely disappointing effort tonight against the Ottawa Senators. The Rangers came up empty on offense, and a large part of that was because of Ottawaês in the neutral zone. They completely eliminated the Rangers speed from the game, which made for an easy night for Craig Anderson.  While the Rangers did register 33 total shots in the game, a majority of them came from the outside. There were several chances were the Rangers were able crack the Senators defense, but Anderson was there to put out the fire as the last line of defense.  If you were watching this game tonight, there was very little excitement in terms of action with the Senators shutting the game down defensively. After a scoreless first period, the Senators were able to add on their only two goals during the second period.  Jean-Gabriel Pageau picked up the first goal off of a miscue in front of the net, which left Pageau wide open for the tap in. Kevin Klein wound up drifting to the corner with the puck behind the net, and Pageau deflected home Tom Pyattês centering feed. Nearing the end of the period, the Senators doubled up their lead with a goal coming from Mark Stone.  Just prior to the goal, the Senators caught a bit of a fortunate bounce with the puck deflecting off of the referee on an attempted clearing attempt. The puck wound up going right to Mark Stone after the deflection, and he snapped it past Antti Raanta for the 2-0 lead. The Rangers attempted a push back later on in the third period, but the Senators stifling defense restricted them from getting any high-quality chances. Following tonightês disappointing loss, the Rangers will look to rebound on Tuesday night as they head into Raleigh for a meeting with the Carolina Hurricanes.  "
23,1 Regular,11/29/2016,7:30 PM,,Buffalo Sabres,4,5,L,,14,8,1,L 1,35,15,2,4,0,28,13,3,5,0,"14,259",2:36,"Eichel has 2 points in season debut, Sabres beat Senators","Jack Eichel finally made his season debut and gave the Buffalo Sabres a big boost. After missing the first 21 games due to sprained ankle just before the season opener, Eichel had a goal and an assist to help the Sabres beat the Ottawa Senators 5-4 on Tuesday night.  I was really excited and had a lot of energy waiting for the game to start,  Eichel said.  I think it helps a little bit when you're able to get a couple points on the power play at the beginning of the game. It kind of settles you down.  Ryan O'Reilly had two goals and an assist for Buffalo, and Kyle Okposo and Sam Reinhart also scored.  It's a momentum thing,  O'Reilly said.  You go out there and you watch (Eichel's) line and they're possessing and he's making plays and creating and coming on right after that it's the same thing, you kind of feed off that.  The power play too, once he gets the puck it's so tough for people to get it off him.  Robin Lehner started and gave up one goal on six shots before leaving late in the first period. Anders Nilsson replaced him and stopped 26 shots for Buffalo. Sabres coach Dan Bylsma said Lehner is day to day with a hip injury. Mike Hoffman had three goals and an assist for the Senators, and Mark Stone also scored in his 200th NHL game. Craig Anderson, making his sixth straight start, made 23 saves. Ottawa scored twice on the power play, but also gave up three while short-handed.  We lost the special teams battle,  Anderson said.  At the end of the day you've got to win the special teams battle or tie it to give yourself a chance. Usually we're pretty good, but we just weren't able to shut those guys down for some reason.  Senators coach Guy Boucher said his team's slow start was the difference.  That's what killed us, that's what sank us,  Boucher said.  I think our guys showed, like usual, a resiliency in coming back and we wanted it to be a one-goal game coming into the third so we did that. So we were only one goal behind, but then we didn't get the goal.  O'Reilly extended Buffalo's lead to 5-3 with a power-play goal with 3:17 left. Hoffman got the Senators within one on the game's fifth power-play goal with 1:31 remaining to complete his hat trick with his seventh of the season, but that was as close as Ottawa got. Trailing 3-1, Stone got the Senators within one on a power-play goal at 8:20 of the second after pouncing on a loose puck. It gave him five goals and four assists in his last eight games. The Sabres restored their two-goal lead as Evander Kane's shot deflected past Anderson off Reinhart's skate with 2:52 left in the second. Ottawa cut the lead again as Hoffman tipped Erik karlsson 's shot just 43 seconds later. Buffalo opened the scoring 6:16 in with a power-play goal as Ottawa's Cody Ceci tried to tie up Reinhart in front of the net, but instead had Okposo's shot go in off his skate. Eichel scored his first, on the power play, 3:15 later. The Senators cut the lead in half as Hoffman buried Mark borowiecki 's rebound with 6;13 left in the period, but the Sabres replied 31 seconds later as O'Reilly came into the slot and scored off his backhand. By the end of the game the Senators were without Bobby Ryan, who aggravated a hand injury early in the second and Marc Methot who suffered a lower body injury late in the second. NOTES: Senators G Andrew Hammond was recalled early Tuesday and was a healthy scratch, as was LW Max McCormick and D Fredrik Claesson. ... The Sabres were without D Zach Bogosian (knee) and D Dmitry Kulikov (unknown). UP NEXT Sabres: Host the New York Rangers on Thursday night. Senators: Host Philadelphia on Thursday night.  ",Ary M,Sens lose wild one 5-4 to Sabres,"Mike Hoffman probably wishes his first career hat-trick came under better circumstances. The Hoff was on fire, but it wasnêt quite enough to overcome the Sabres in a 5-4 loss. Being on a four-game win streak, the Senators were due for a stinker. Craig Anderson looked human, and their dominant powerplay allowed three goals on five chances. It was ugly, but even the best teams have ugly games every now and then. Things didnêt start out great for Ottawa. Derick Brassard took a high-sticking penalty six minutes in, and the Sabres needed seven seconds to score on that powerplay. Cody Ceci did a good job of tying up Sam Reinhart in front, but it meant the pass intended for Reinhart hit Ceciês skate and went into a wide-open cage. Mark Borowiecki would get called for hooking two minutes later, and this time it took them more than a minute to score on the powerplay. Jack Eichel showed why heês been missed so much, firing home a one-timer than Anderson was genuinely surprised to see beat him. Hoffman gave Ottawa a ray of hope, scoring a rebound goal against Robin Lehner. But 31 seconds later, Ryan OêReilly fired home a backhander (while missing his helmet), and restored the two-goal lead. Apparently Lehner knew this game would get out of hand. Heêd never allowed more than two goals to the Sens in his career, so with a couple minutes left in the first period, he left with a hip injury to maintain that stat. Anders Nilsson would come in and be good enough to win. Bobby Ryan also presumably re-aggravated his hand injury in the first period, and left with only 2:50 played. Boucher has since announced he wonêt play next game. The second period would see the injury troubles get worse for the Sens. Marc Methot left after blocking a shot, and wouldnêt return. He was listed as day-to-day after the game, so he might be in the lineup next game. The period would also see the Sens bring back within one twice, first via a Mark Stone goal, and then Hoffmanês second after Reinhart had scored. Somehow outshooting the Sabres 17-4 wasnêt quite enough. The third period would see a more even run of play. Likely Dan Bylsma was not impressed by his team trying to just hold on to the lead for 40 minutes. But with just four minutes left in the game, captain Karlsson would get called for interference. Already short Methot, another defenceman in the box made everything worse for Ottawa. And sure enough, OêReilly got his second of the game. But Ottawa would get another powerplay (a makeup call?) just moments later, and Dion Phaneuf kept teeing up Hoffman until finally he hit the net. It brought the Sens back within one for one last effort, but they couldnêt get the tying goal. At least now next game wonêt have the pressure of trying to preserve a winning streak. Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman No surprise here. Hoffman finished with three goals and an assist, and his shot was looking lethal all night. Hard to believe it was his first career hat-trick. Dishonourable Mention: Offsides Anyone else see the Sens go offside 22 times in the first period? Dishonourable Mention: Slap passes Early in the game, Hoffman got a great chance by redirecting a slap pass from Chris Wideman. After that, the Sens seemed to try the slap pass every 35 seconds. It turned into icings, turnovers, and glorious chances to score passed over. This is the first game all season I can remember players repeatedly passing up shooting chances to slap pass it to nobody, and it was infuriating. Sens Zero: Penalty kill Theyêve been so good for so long, so itês hard to criticize too much. But they just couldnêt get it figured out tonight, and the Sabres roasted them for it. Hopefully it was just a one-game aberration. And hopefully Methot isnêt out for long.  Sens Killers: Jack Eichel and Ryan OêReilly They finished with two and three points respectively, and were the main reasons the Sabresê powerplay was so deadly. Eichel in particular really showed why heês been billed as a franchise player since he was 16.  ",Die By the Blade,"Eichel shines as Sabres win 5-4, Lehner injured","The Buffalo Sabres got three things last night that they desperately needed - Jack Eichel returned to the ice, they exploded for five goals, and most importantly, they got a much-needed win over the Ottawa Senators. Eichel's debut was everything Sabres fans wanted and more. Six minutes into the game, the Sabres went on the power play, and it only took seven seconds for Eichel to remind everyone what a special player he is. A sharp, cross-ice pass gave Kyle Okposo a free path to the net, and he would bank it off of a skate to put the Sabres up 1-0. As if that sweet assist wasnÍt good enough, the Sabres would get another power play about three minutes later, and Eichel would blast a Ryan OÍReilly pass from the off-wing past Craig Anderson, who gave a fantastic ñHuh?î reaction after EichelÍs laser found its way under his arm and into the net. Unfortunately, the first period wasnÍt all good, as Robin Lehner would leave late thanks to tightness in his hip. Lehner would return to the bench later in the game and coach Dan Bylsma said that he would be day-to-day. The Senators would mount a strong comeback on the shoulders of Mike Hoffman, who scored his first NHL hat trick, but the Sabres would hold strong thanks to a goal from Sam Reinhart and two from Ryan OÍReilly. Many key Sabres had multi-point nights tonight, including OÍReilly, Reinhart, Eichel, Ristolainen, and Okposo. Five goals will do that, and the scoring combined with EichelÍs return made this the most enjoyable Sabres game to watch all year. Three Questions 1. How does Eichel look in his return? In the first ten minutes, Eichel had a beautiful cross-ice assist and a gorgeous one-timer for his first two points of the season. As awesome as that was, it was equally exciting to remember how good he is at the little things - shielding the puck down low, stick handling in tight spaces, making hard passes look easy, and pressuring defenders with his gigantic stick. This team desperately missed Eichel, and he reminded everyone why heÍs so special in his debut tonight. 2. How will EichelÍs return affect the other reshuffled lines? EichelÍs return certainly gave the Sabres a top power play unit that IÍd put up against any team in the league - Eichel, OÍReilly, Okposo, Reinhart, and Ristolainen. That unit generated two goals in its first two chances, and scored a third later in the game. 3. Will either team take a two-goal lead? The Sabres did, going up 3-1 in the first, and two of the lowest-scoring teams in hockey played a barn burner after that."

The Philadelphia captain scored twice, the second 40 seconds into overtime in the Flyers' 3-2 victory over the Senators on Thursday night. Giroux's two-goal outing came a night after he was engaged to girlfriend Ryanne Breton of Ottawa. ""It was pretty special (to get engaged) and to get the win was icing on the cake,"" said Giroux, who grew up in the area. Michael Del Zotto also scored, and Steve Mason made 19 saves. The Flyers have won three in a row to improve to 12-10-3. ""It was a much needed outcome for us on the road and a pretty good effort from our group all the way through,"" Flyers coach Dave Hakstol said. Mike Hoffman and Ryan Dzingel scored Ottawa, and Mike Condon made 29 saves. The Senators dropped to 14-8-2. Ottawa took a 2-0 lead just 1:57 into the second when Dzingel knocked down the puck in front and put a stick on it to lift it pass Mason for his sixth of the season. ""We had a good first, good third, but our second definitely we could have done better,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""We stopped shooting. We created less momentum in the offensive zone and they grabbed that and got some power plays and grabbed that part of the momentum. "" The Flyers rallied to tie it with two goals in minute. Giroux scored with 3:10 left, firing a shot off that caught the inside of condon 's blocker and went in. Del Zotto tied it when he tipped in Mark Streit's shot. ""Any time you blow a lead whether it's one goal or two goals it always hurts,"" Dzingel said. ""We had a chance in overtime even though we gave up those two goals and we couldn't capitalize, so obviously it hurts losing that one point. "" The Senators opened the scoring in the first on hoffman 's power-play goal. He has five goals in six games. NOTES: The Grey Cup champion Ottawa Redblacks were on hand for a ceremonial faceoff. Quarterback Henry Burris and receiver Brad Sinopoli dropped the puck from the Grey Cup. ... Ottawa was down to five defenseman for the third period after Fredrik Claesson suffered a lower-body injury. ... Philadelphia D Brandon Manning missed his third straight with an upper-body injury. LW Scott Laughton and D Nick Schultz were healthy scratches. UP NEXT: Flyers: Host Chicago on Saturday. Senators: Host Florida on Saturday night.  ",Ross A,Senators lose to Flyers in OT,"It wasnêt a pretty one, but every point matters. The Senators were outshot 25-12 after two periods, and 32-21 overall, but managed to carry it to overtime. The opening goal was a beauty. Some great quick passing on the powerplay led to somehow Mike Hoffman of all people being open for the backdoor pass. Mark Stone wasnêt going to miss that pass, and Hoffman wasnêt going to miss on an open net, no matter how sharp the angle. The second goal of the game came off Ryan Dzingelês stick. He managed to nick a bouncing puck in front of the net, over Steve Mason, and into the net. But the Flyers werenêt content to fall behind, and poured on the offence. They finally got on the board when captain Claude Giroux snapped one past Mike Condon. And then the Flyers tied it on one I think shouldêve been called off. Michael Del Zottoês point shot appeared to hit Pierre-Edouard Bellemare in front of the net. However, Bellemareês stick was too high, and so it wouldêve negated the goal. I thought the puck clearly changed direction when it went very near his stick, but I guess the war room disagreed, because the goal counted, and it was credited to Del Zotto. Go figure. The third would actually see the Sens outshoot the Flyers, and they had some decent chances, but nothing could solve the deadlock. However, it only took 40 seconds of overtime for the game to end. The Sens seemed a little... lazy in their defensive coverage? Something like that. Anyway, it seemed like Jakub Voracek and Giroux were both given way too much space, and Giroux wasnêt going to miss on a one-timer from four feet outside the crease. Still, the Sens got a point, and every point will matter for the playoff race. Honourable Mention: Chris Wideman I thought he looked pretty good tonight, and the stats seem to back it up. Importantly, with Marc Methot injured, he was put into the top four to play with Dion Phaneuf. Not only is he playing well in my eyes, but heês earned the trust of his coach. Dishonourable Mention: Cody Ceci and Mark Borowiecki Itês looking like these guys need a dependable partner to play well. People keep pointing out that Boucherês system caters to the left defenceman especially, so maybe the problem is that Ceci isnêt as good at covering for Boroês pinches as Wideman. Anyway, Iêm not discouraged based on how theyêve played recently, this was just not a great game for them. ",Broad Street Hockey,Noted good hockey player Claude Giroux pushes Flyers to OT win,"After Tuesdayês contest against the Bruins, one in which the most frequent frustrating game narrative of the Flyersê season (play well for most of the game, have some bad defensive breakdowns/penalty-killing/poor goaltending, lose) was flipped on its head (team plays terribly for most of the game, is bailed out by its goaltending, wins in shootout), it was only fitting to expect that the Flyers may have a bit of a letdown tonight more reminiscent of some of their early-season losses this year. If only because, yêknow, weêre Flyers fans who arenêt really allowed to have good things continue to happen to us for extended periods of time. And through about 35 minutes of this game, it looked like we were going to get just that. Thanks to a power play goal off of some great offensive zone passing and a point shot that bounced off of Mark Streit right onto Ryan Dzingelês stick, the Flyers looked poised to cough up another game that they largely controlled. But then a funny thing happened: the Flyers won. Again. Yes, two goals a minute apart late in the second period tied the score at 2 apiece, and after a scoreless third period bereft of much action or suspense, a fantastic sequence between the teamês two top forwards created the game-winner less than a minute into overtime, giving the Flyers a 3-2 road win over the Ottawa Senators for their second three-game winning streak of the season. Itês easy to pick the hero in this one, as Claude Giroux   fresh off of a somewhat important Real Life Achievement last night   scored two goals tonight, one of which opened up the Flyersê scoring and one of which ended the game in overtime. (Guess this is what happens when heês trying to impress the people in the stands when heês playing nearby to his home of Hearst, Ontario.) Jakub Voracek also gets a shoutout, as he set up both of those goals in fairly impressive fashion. But there was a lot to like across the board tonight! The Shayne Gostisbehere - Andrew MacDonald pairing actually played very well, on both sides of the pair, and for the second game in a row they were unquestionably the Flyersê best pairing on defense. The Travis Konecny/Wayne Simmonds line looked a bit more active, particularly in the offensive zone, with Brayden Schenn playing center. And the Flyers as a whole out-shot Ottawa 32-21 and out-attempted them handily as well   79-51 overall, 63-43 at 5-on-5. (Also, the Flyers miiiiiiiight have caught a break on not being called offsides before their first goal. Shhh.) As always, not all was perfect. Special teams didnêt swing the Flyersê way tonight, as they were immediately gashed on one of the two penalty kills they had and they couldnêt cash in on any of four attempts of their own. And the team definitely let up on the gas a bit in the third period, maybe playing for overtime a bit more than youêd like to see. All in all, though, itês just nice to see good things happening, still spend most of the night expecting the worst (because, well, itês us), only to be pleasantly surprised to pick up two points when all is said and done. The win puts the Flyers within one win of actual-.500 (in other words, as many wins as losses) for the first time since November 5. Exciting times! Chicago on Saturday afternoon back in South Philly. Four ... wins in a row? Itêd be cool. Go Flyers. Observations in the morning.   "
25,1 Regular,12/3/2016,7:00 PM,,Florida Panthers,2,0,W,,15,8,2,W 1,21,8,0,7,0,24,14,0,4,0,"15,149",2:30,"Condon stops 24 shots, Senators score early to beat Panthers","A quick scoring burst and a solid outing from their goalie was all the Ottawa Senators needed in their latest win. Erik Karlsson and Derick Brassard scored 19 seconds apart in the first period, Mike Condon stopped 24 shots for his second shutout of the season, and the Senators beat the Florida Panthers 2-0 Saturday night. We came out to play right from the start and it translated into the whole game. We had great goaltending and that kept us in the game, Karlsson said. We battled hard all game and they made it hard for us. They showed they are a good team and created their fair share of scoring chances, but Condon played great for us. Ottawa snapped a two-game skid and handed Florida its third loss in four games (1-2-1). Roberto Luongo made 19 saves, including just five in the third period. The Senators did have two breakaways in the final 5 minutes but didnt register a shot on goal. Its a tough one to swallow, Panthers defenseman Keith Yandle said. They had a good start and sometimes you have to weather the storm throughout courses of games and they did a good job in the first 10 or 12 minutes. If you look at the second period we were better. I thought there were stretches where we were good offensively and sometimes you run into a hot goalie. For most of the game we did the right thing and they got a couple of early goals. Both goals required some fancy foot work. On the first, Karlsson had a pass from behind the net bounce off his stick right to his left foot. He then kicked the puck back to his stick and beat Luongo from the top of the crease at 6:46. Brassard then took a pass at the side of the net and kicked the puck to his stick before cutting around a fallen Luongo to score. The Panthers managed just one shot on goal through the first 14 minutes. The goalie is only as good as his defense and the defense was very good, Condon said. It comes down to team defense and guys buying in. Tonight that was a good example with just 24 shots and not many Grade-A chances against, which makes it very manageable. Each team had two power-play chances over the first two periods. The Senators had the first four power plays of the game but all they could create was one shot on goal. The Panthers had two power plays, including a 5-on-3 for 1:23 in the second period, and had several good scoring chances with five shots, but could get nothing past Condon. Condon also stopped Vincent Trocheck on a breakaway earlier in the second. The Senators finished 0 for 7 on the power play and managed just six shots while the Panthers went 0 for 4. NOTES: Marc Methot and Craig Anderson were scratches for the Senators. ... Dylan McIlrath and Kyle Rau were scratches for the Panthers. ... Senators D Andreas Englund made his NHL debut Saturday. ... Panthers D Jakub Kindlplayed in his 300th game. UP NEXT Panthers: At Boston on Monday night in the fifth game of a season-high six-game, 10-day trip. Senators: At Pittsburgh on Monday night in the opener of a four-game trip.  ",Ross A,Sens blank Panthers 2-0,"Ah, it feels good to win again. That two-game skid felt a little rough for the Senators, but this win puts them right back where they belong. 7th in the league, 2nd in the division, and only two points behind the Canadiens who are a trendy Cup pick. Sure the Habs have a game in hand, but still, at 25 games into the season, you canêt say the Sens are just getting lucky for a couple games. The game started as well as you could hope. Erik Karlsson opened the scoring on a play that was so Karlsson. After an attempted breakaway pass for Ryan Dzingel just didnêt quite connect, the Sens still entered the zone with possession. The problem was, they were in the midst of a line change, so Karlsson went to the front of the net. But once the Sens completed the change, he stayed at the front of the net. He attempted to one-time Dzingelês pass from behind the net, but Jussi Jokinen got his stick in the right place. It didnêt matter to the captain though, because he just kicked the puck back to his stick and fired it home. Sometimes defencemen forecheck when their team is changing, but I donêt think Iêve ever seen one (besides Karlsson) who will go play the front of the net while the forwards change. It only took 20 seconds for the Sens to get their second. The entire play was a thing of beauty. First, Mark Borowiecki stood up his man in the neutral zone. It was a great example of how Guy Boucherês system of pressuring the puck carrier by the left-side D fits perfectly into Boroês game. Mark Stone would then carry it in and lose it, Mike Hoffman gathered the puck and fired a pass to Stone who somehow found his way into the slot. Meanwhile, Derick Brassard had headed right to the front of the net, Stone hit him with the perfect pass, and he deked around Roberto Luongo for the goal. Everyone on the ice played their role to perfection, and the goal was scintillating. Unfortunately for lovers of offence, that would do it for scoring in the game. Fortunately for Sens fans, that means that team won with a shutout. From my opinion, Mike Condon wasnêt amazing for the shutout, but that says something - the team didnêt need him to be. He was strong on Vincent Trocheckês breakaway, and stood tall when Florida pushed for goals with their goalie pulled with three minutes left, but the Sens did a decent job of keeping his night manageable. Ottawa was only outshot 24-21 in a game in which they led for 53 minutes. Digging into things a little more deeply, you can really see the system at play. The Sens lost the 5v5 shot attempt battle (43%) but won the 5v5 unblocked shot attempt battle (53%). That shows you how much Ottawa is blocking shots, limiting traffic to the goalie. If you look at the shots below, you can see that a lot of Floridaês shots came from either sharp angles, or way back at the point. Most of Ottawaês shots come from the middle of the ice, even the point shots. The fact that Ottawa could force Florida outside, and limit their shots, while protecting a lead is a testament to The System (TM). I donêt want to paint Guy Boucher as some kind of saviour, or say that all our hopes have come true, but this is promising overall. Honourable Mention: Mike Condon As I said above, this wasnêt a heroic shutout, but rather a well-earned team shutout. Still, you canêt get a shutout without your goalie doing his part, and Condon did that tonight. Honourable Mention: Jean-Gabriel Pageau It was a weird look at first to see him on Turrisês wing, but it ended up being a great fit. It freed him up to forecheck as a winger, and it seemed to suit his ability well. Dzingel-Turris have looked good this season, and if Pageau can work with them, thatêll be great until Bobby Ryan gets back. Debut: Andreas Englund I thought he looked nervous tonight, but not necessarily out of place. Heês obviously young, but I donêt remember any egregious mistakes. And his team didnêt allow a goal, so heêll probably take that any day.   ",Litter Box Cats,"Condon, Senators blank Panthers 2-0","Mike Condon made twenty-four saves to lead the Ottawa Senators to a 2-0 win over the Florida Panthers at Canadian Tire Center on Saturday night. The loss dropped the Cats record to 1-2-1 on its current six-game road trip that still has stops to make in Boston and Philadelphia. Ottawa scored twice in a 19-second span of the first period to provide the gameês only goals. Erik Karlsson opened the scoring at the 6:46 mark, taking advantage of some shoddy coverage from both Aaaron Ekbald and Jussi Jokinen to rap Ryan Dzingelês centering pass by Roberto Luongo. Jean-Gabriel Pageau picked up the second assist on the play.  The Senators quickly added to the lead when the tic-tac-toe passing of Chris Wideman and Mike Hoffman opened up the Florida defense, giving Derick Brassard the time and space needed to beat Luongo. After getting out-shot 9-5 in the opening frame, the Panthers tightened up and limited the Senators to just 12 shots the rest of the way, but they couldnêt find a way to solve Condon, who was wisely acquired from the Pittsburgh Penguins on November 2, at the other end. The 26-year-old netminder robbed rookie Denis Malgin late in the game to keep the Panthers off the board. Floridaês record under interim coach Tom Rowe now stands at 1-1-1. The Cats have only managed to score three times in those three games. Law & Order Mike Condonês shutout was his second of the season. Condon has appeared in six games and has posted a 3-1-1 record and 1.66 GAA since joining the Sens. After an 0 for 6 performance in Detroit, the Panthers went 0 for 4 on the power play in Ottawa. The Cats PK was impressive, killing off all seven Ottawa opportunities. Vincent Trocheck, Aleksander Barkov, Jaromir Jagr and Jason Demers each finished the game with three shots on goal. Condon denied Trocheck on a second period breakaway. Roberto Luongo made 19 stops and lowered his GAA to 2.04. Luongoês record now stands at 9-7-1 with a .929 save percentage. Goal support needed, stat. Rookie blueliner Andreas Englund dished out a game-high seven hits while making his NHL debut for the Senators. Florida defenseman Jakub Kindl hit a nice milestone, playing in his 300th career tilt. Kindl finished with a -1 rating for the fourth straight game.

It just seems that way. Bryan Rust had his first career hat trick, Sidney Crosby added his NHL-leading 17th goal and the Penguins raced past the Ottawa Senators 8-5 on Monday night. Pittsburgh poured in six goals over the final 32 minutes after spotting the Senators a 4-2 lead. This group has provided enough evidence that regardless of what happens, we have the firepower, the talent level, the capability to win games, Sullivan said. Theres a belief that regardless of what the score is, we can win. Evgeni Malkin and Phil Kessel each had a goal and two assists for the Penguins, and Matt Cullen and Justin Schultz also scored. Matt Murray made 17 saves after relieving an ineffective Marc-Andre Fleury in the second period. Anytime youre forced to change goalies it gets everybodys attention, Cullen said. Pittsburgh has won three straight overall and improved to 7-0-2 in its last nine against the Senators. The Penguins also won a game in which they trailed by two for the 13th time since Sullivan took over as coach last December. This team (Pittsburgh), you just open the door a little bit and theyll just barge in, Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said. So, we have to be better with a two-goal lead, thats for sure. Well learn how to do that. Matt Stone had a goal and two assists for the Senators. Erik Karlsson, Mike Hoffman, Mark Stone and Dion Phaneuf also scored for Ottawa, which lost in regulation for just the second time in its last eight games. Craig Anderson spent most of the night under siege by the Penguins and stopped 36 of the 43 shots he faced before being pulled following Rusts successful penalty shot 12:36 into the third. Rust picked up his first hat trick since his college days playing for Notre Dame on an empty-netter with 2:28 remaining. The crowd waited until the goal was upheld on review before showering the ice with hats. I just think they didnt think I would get a hat trick, joked Rush, who finished with four points in all. Rust opened the scoring by taking a pretty feed from Malkin and jamming it by Anderson just 1:45 into the game, setting the tone for a wild three periods that produced 13 goals on a combined 80 shots. The Senators chased Fleury when Hoffman pounded home a one-timer from the right circle to make it 4-2 at 7:08 of the second period. Fleury stopped 12 of 16 shots and was hurt by shoddy play in front of him and at least one bad bounce: Stone knocked a carom off the glass behind the Pittsburgh goal out of midair and into the open net. You hate to leave your goalie hanging out to dry, Cullen said. The goals we gave up, there were a couple that were unfortunate.  Murray entered to a loud ovation from the 445th consecutive sellout crowd in Pittsburgh and his team responded almost immediately, scoring three times in a span of 6:09 to take the lead. Cullens short-handed breakaway sparked the surge. Kessel tied it with a nasty wrist shot from between the circles and Schultz finished it with a wrist shot of his own to give the Penguins a 5-4 lead. Ottawa stuck with Anderson, making his first start since taking a brief leave of absence to be with his wife as she battles throat cancer, even after the deluge. It backfired. Malkin squeezed past two defenders to flip a backhand by Anderson 1:05 into the third to put the Penguins up 6-4. Phaneuf brought the Senators back within one with Ottawas third power-play goal, but Pittsburghs beleaguered penalty killers finally got a stop a couple of minutes later and Rust went high with the backhand on his penalty shot to give the Penguins the breathing room they needed. NOTES: Ottawa went 3 for 5 on the power play. The Senators had scored just 10 times with the man advantage coming in. ... Pittsburgh went 0 for 4 on the power play. ... Pittsburgh has won 28 straight games in which Crosby and Malkin both scored. ... The Senators scratched C Marc Methot. ... Pittsburgh scratched forward Tom Kuhnhackl, C Jake Guentzel and D Steve Olesky. ... Fleurys early exit marked the third time in 17 starts he failed to complete the game. He was pulled early only once in 58 starts last season. UP NEXT Senators: Travel to San Jose on Wednesday, the start of a three-game set in California that includes visits to Anaheim and Los Angeles. Penguins: Begin a two-game road swing through Florida on Thursday when they face the Panthers.  ",Callum Fraser,Penguins Top Senators 8-5 in Emotional Game,"After a rather painless October and an unchallenging November, the Senators began the first of many testing matchups in the month of December. Deathcember, if you will, had begun. And what better way to start the scariest stretch of hockey of the season, but with the reigning Stanley Cup Champions? Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Chris Kunitz, Phil Kessel, Kris Letang; the list of top tier players on the Pittsburgh Penguins is nearly endless. And while stars are plentiful in their lineup, the Penguinsê forward depth is arguably the best in the league and one of the biggest reasons they took home the NHLês top prize last season. But no Matt Murray on Monday night. That would prove to be a saving grace for the Senators, especially in the first period, as they faced Marc-Andre Fleury who was rocking an unattractive .904 save percentage. And as they do most nights, the Senators would allow the first goal. Off a Mark Borowiecki giveaway, Letang and Malkin combined for a beautiful passing play that ended with Bryan Rust putting his fourth of the year five-hole past Craig Anderson. But just like weêve seen so many times this year already, the Senatorsê newfound ability to never say die allowed them to come back from an early deficit. Twice. First, Ryan Dzingel and Kyle Turris hooked up for a nice breakaway, that Turris promptly finished off with a quick snap shot through Fleuryês wickets. The play was dangerously close to being offside, but after further review, it would stand. Then, after Crosby - of course it was him - made it 2-1 with a snipe other the right shoulder of Anderson, Mark Stone corralled a puck at the point, found Erik Karlsson moving in on the right side boards and the captain fired it, once again, through the wickets of Fleury. The Senators would allow 21 shots in the first frame, a trend that continued throughout the game, as Anderson was in for a very busy 60 minutes. The second period could not have started better for the away team. Ottawa took advantage of one power play. And then they took advantage of another. In the end, Mike Hoffman extended his point streak to five, Erik Karlsson took the league lead in points from defensemen and the Senators had a two-goal lead. And wow, what an absolute stunner of a goal by Mark Stone.  That was it for Fleury, as well. As it happens, Murray would not get the night off. The lead would not last long. Everyone knows the firepower the Penguins have, and it was on display for the final 12 minutes of the second frame. With goals from Kessel, Matt Cullen and Justin Shultz, Pittsburgh quickly took a hold of the game. Anderson probably shouldêve had one or two of the five scored, but poor defensive work from Borowiecki and Dion Phaneuf put the Senators netminder in a vulnerable position too many times.  So when it looked like the four-game road trip through hell was going to start with a bang, Ottawa headed to the dressing room with a mountain to climb. It mightêve only been one goal, but the Penguins donêt exactly fall back and turtle when they have a lead. Just as the third period was opening up, Malkin made Borowiecki look silly, only to squeak one past Anderson. Ottawa would get one back, and again on the power play, as Phaneuf whacked home a rebound in front of the net. The Senators have looked a hell of a lot better on the man advantage the past couple weeks. The team is 7/19 in their last five games, with a 36.8 percent success rate. But after that, it was all Penguins. Bryan Rust would add another two goals - one on a penalty shot from a weak call on Mark Stone and the empty-netter - for his first career hat trick. Anderson was pulled after the seventh goal, but it was far too late as the home team took it by a score of 8-5 in the end.  You can exhale now. Sens Hero(es): Erik Karlsson, Mike Hoffman and Mark Stone While their bottom six has been anything but strong this season, the Senators continue to get a lot of help from their best players. Karlsson had a four-point night, Hoffman scored yet again and Mark Stone was creating chance after chance. Sens Killer: Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin As usual, Crosby scored. So nothing is new on that front. And along with his third period goal, Malkin was making plays left, right and centre throughout the night. The Senatorsê best players were on, but the Pensê best players were better. Sens Killer: Bryan Rust Kind of have to give a mention to the guy with a hat trick, yêknow? Sens Killer: Matt Murray Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan made the move of the game when he pulled Fleury with his team down 4-2. Murray would only let in one goal on his way to recording a win and 17 saves.  ",Pensburgh,"Goals Aplenty, Pittsburgh Shows Out in Win","1st period Early in, Kris Letang holds the blueline and passes down to Evgeni Malkin. Malkin makes an unreal play with vision and touch to lay the puck right into space for Bryan Rust to catch up to. Rust snaps a shot past Craig Anderson 5-hole to put the Penguins on the board. The Senators strike back soon, with Kyle Turris slipping past the Penguins defense and Brian Dumoulin whiffing on the centering pass. Breakaway chance and Turris beats Marc-Andre Fleury 5-hole himself. The Pens challenged the goal hoping to catch Turris offside but review couldn't overturn the close play and the goal stands. On the very next shift though, the Sidney Crosby goal scoring machine kicked into gear with his 17th goal of the season (in his 20th game) on a 2-on-1. Nice pass by Conor Sheary to spring Sid. Ottawa doesn't stay down long, their best player makes a good play when Erik Karlsson takes a cross-ice pass from Mark Stone and puts a hard shot right under the leg pad Fleury. MAF immediately tipped his head back, showing frustration to know he should have had that one.  Pittsburgh put 21 shots on net in the first period, had a couple of power plays in there but bombarded the net. Entertaining, wide-open hockey, but unfortunately for all that effort the period ends with a 2-2 tie. 2nd period Ottawa gets their first power play and first power play goal, Stone makes a really nice play waiting for a falling puck to get under the crossbar and he knocks it into the net to make it 3-2 Sens and their first lead of the game. Crosby gets a great scoring chance but can't put in a wraparound chance. Ottawa gets their second PP chance and goal, a nice play by Karlsson and Fleury looks like he loses vision of where the puck is going, which was problematic since it was going to Mike Hoffman and the talented player quickly one-times the puck into the net to make it 4-2. Fleury is pulled after allowing 4 goals on 16 shots and Matt Murray enters the game. The Pens take a penalty soon after and the situation looks dire, but Matt Cullen gets a short-handed breakaway and scores with a nice move on the backhand on one of his former teams to close the gap to 4-3. Still some great wheels on Cullen at age 40. Pittsburgh ties the game at 4, Phil Kessel scores an NHL17 type goal with a long wrist-shot high to the blocker side from deep out. Heck of a shot but one you don't see scored in the real NHL very often. Just 24 seconds later, the Pens strike again to take a 5-4 lead with Justin Schultz stepping up in a big way defensively, then regaining the puck in the o-zone and shooting confidently for his 3rd goal of the season, all coming in the last 4 games. 3rd period Evgeni Malkin blows the doors off Mark Borowiecki and somehow sneaks a backhand shot by Anderson to make it 6-4. Wow, wow, wow. As Pens twitter says below, it does remind one of the Mario statue goal out in front of the arena.  Ottawa gets up to 3/4 on the night on the power play with a wild scramble in front of Murray that Dion Phaeuf gets the last stick on to make it 6-5 Pens with still some time left for more.. And the more comes shortly, as it has been all game. Bryan Rust earns a breakaway with an interception and his speed but gets slashed and awarded a penalty shot. Beauty of a backhand move for his 2nd goal of the night and to make a score a ridiculous 7-5. Rust opened the scoring just 1:45 into the game, and he'll close the scoring 2:28 left with an empty net goal to finish out the 8-5 win. Some Thoughts Great play by Malkin on the opening goal. How he knew right where Rust would be was a thing of beauty. In the bigger picture, that goal was the culmination of a minute long shift for Malkin who was buzzing all around the offensive zone. The Pens traded Mike Condon to Ottawa last month, and he got a shutout in Ottawa's last game...But not the start tonight as the Sens elected to play their normal starter in Anderson. A bit of a curious challenge just 8 minutes into the game, costing the Pens their timeout and a chance for challenges later.  Ironic trivia note: Ryan Dzingel (the player who made the nice pass to Turris on the breakaway for Ottawa's first goal) is a 7th round pick (204th overall) from 2011 that Ottawa received in the 2011 trade that sent Alex Kovalev to the Pens. Dzingel is off to a great start this season with 14 points in 26 games, a huge bucking of the odds. But, then again Pittsburgh doesn't have to feel too bad, they had pick 210 that year and found a diamond in the rough that late in the draft in Scott Wilson . 3 straight healthy scratches for Jake Guentzel after tonight. Now that Chris Kunitz and Patric Hornqvist are healthy (and there's production lately from Rust and Sheary) it sure does seem like there's no room for Guentzel right now. Wouldn't be too surprising to see him sent back to the AHL for a place to be able to play for now. Fleury got the early hook, Fleury's play on the 2nd goal was one he should have stopped and though Ottawa did generate some scoring chances, he couldn't keep the puck out of the net, allowing 4 goals on 16 shots in less than half a game. One didn't get a sense MAF would stop the next high danger scoring chance, and Murray did stop 2 breakaways in the 2nd after coming in cold, so that move appeared to have immediately paid off.  One of the most engaged games for Malkin this season who had the ridiculous goal, plus 2 assists, team high 6 shots on goal and a takeaway. Dion Phaneuf (who Malkin often battles dating back to Dion's Toronto days) got in Geno's face early, but that backfired as Malkin stayed focused, didn't take any penalties and was very good with the puck all night long. Few are less complimentary of karlsson 's defensive efforts at times than I am, so only fair to give the devil his due and point out a great play he made to use his stick to stop Crosby from scoring on an empty net in the 2nd period. And he was great, as always, in the offensive zone with a 4 point night (1g+3a). Crosby's first period goal was his 965th career NHL point, tying him with all-time great Maurice  The Rocket  Richard for 90th place all-time. History making stuff. Fitting that Sid ties The Rocket on a play the Habs great would have recognized, flying down the ice and ripping a goal on the rush. Brian Dumoulin hit Curtis Lazar along the boards in the 2nd period, and Lazar wouldn't return. The hit look like it was from the side/back-ish so I guess we'll see if there's any supplemental discipline but given that the NHL barely suspends for egregious hits, this one probably was under their threshold for further action. Two more points apiece for the super-hot pair of Ian Cole (2 assists tonight) and Schultz (1g+1a). Who knows how long they will stay this productive (especially Cole, since at least Schultz should be able to generate shots and goals with his skill) but the Pens will definitely take it while it lasts. Aside from the Cullen goal, the penalty kill was dreadful giving up 3 goals in 5 chances. They couldn't buy a clear and seem to collapse too much, not covering particularly anyone and not actually dispossessing the puck either. Rust's first NHL hat-trick and he scored 3 different ways (ES, penalty shot, empty net). Still a PPG and SHG away from the Mario 5 goals, 5 ways, but not a bad night at all for Rust to double his goals on the season from 3 to 6. 46 SOG for the Pens tonight, dominant effort. Just a wide-open, old school throwback game. Really wild game, but they're always more fun coming out with the win. The Penguins get a 2 day break, and they better make that rest count, because they're starting a 6-game in 10 day stretch, starting Thursday night in Sunrise, FL.  "

It all worked to Ottawas advantage, which extended a nice streak. Kelly scored with 1:06 remaining and Jean-Gabriel Pageau added an empty-net goal, giving the Ottawa Senators a 4-2 victory over the San Jose Sharkson Wednesday night. It was just a safe play, Kelly said. The puck was bouncing around a lot. It bounced past the first defender and then got to the second defenders skate, and I just tried to tip it through and it was in. Mark Stone and Erik Karlsson also scored for the Senators, who beat the Sharks for a fifth straight time. Theyve won three straight in San Jose for the first time ever. Sticks hit, the puck pops up and its a weird goal, Sharks captain Joe Pavelskisaid. Sometimes it works like that. We had more than enough looks to get into it. Logan Couture and Brent Burns scored for the Sharks, who had a three-game winning streak snapped. Mike Condon stopped 35 of 37 shots for the Sens. The Sharks outshot Ottawa 18-4 in the third period, and Martin Jones allowed three goals on 16 shots overall. That was an emotional game, a lot of fun, the kind of game you like to play, Condon said. We wanted to play better with the lead but we kept them at bay and showed a lot of resilience there. Well take the two points and get out of here as quick as we can. The Senators struck quickly, recording a power-play goal less than four minutes into the contest. Mike Hoffman tossed the puck toward the net and it bounced off Burns skate. Burns lost sight of it and Stone picked it up, firing past everybody into the net. Hoffman has a point in six straight games and in eight of nine since missing a pair of contests with an injury. Karlsson made it 2-0 with a goal about four minutes later. Sharks defender Brendan Dillon tried clearing it from in front of the net, but Karlsson was right there to fire it to the high glove side. We caught a break there. Even down 2-0, I think they did a tremendous job in keeping us in our zone, Karlsson said. Condon made some big saves at the right time. We should be happy to be coming away with a late goal the way we did. We did all we could, and they played a terrific game, too. Couture got the Sharks on the board with a power-play goal midway through the second period. The Senators cleared the puck two straight possessions before Pavelski rushed to the net and then slipped the puck to an open Couture, who has six goals in his past eight games, about 10 feet away for the score. You take a penalty, they get a lucky bounce and theyre up two, Couture said. It was a disappointing loss. There were a lot of things we could have done better. Burns tied the score 6:30 into the third period, methodically working the puck to set up a shot that squeezed past Condon to the glove side. NOTES: Senators D Marc Methot missed his fourth straight contest with a lower body injury. ... Stone has eight points in his last six games. ... Karlsson has nine points in his last five games. ... The Sharks recalled F Kevin LeBlanc and D Mirco Mueller. Mueller was a healthy scratch. ... Sharks D Paul Martinrecorded his 300th NHL point with an assist on Burns goal. UP NEXT: Senators: Continue a four-game trip at the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday. Sharks: Travel to Anaheim for a game Friday night and then return home to face Carolina on Saturday night.  ",Callum Fraser,Karlsson Makes History as Senators Win in San Jose,"After Deathcember got off to a rather nutty start in Pittsburgh, the Senators travelled Southwest to California to begin another road trip through Death Valley. If you think you sense a theme here, youêre right. While we still had to wait a few hours to find out who the three stars of the game would be, Senators fans along the East Coast who planned to watch the full 60-plus minutes had already be awarded hardest worker. And those fans that decided to stay up were rewarded in the first period. The Senators power play - which was 18th in the league and rising during its current hot streak - was successful for the fourth time in six attempts since Monday night. Off a bit of a broken play, Erik Karlssonês shot from the point was blocked, Mike Hoffman picked up the loose puck and fired it but that too was blocked, then Mark Stone found it in the slot and chipped a backhander over the blocker of Sharks netminder Martin Jones. With the assist, Karlsson tied Wade Redden for the No. 1 spot on the Senatorsê franchise list of points by a defenseman. Just three minutes later, the captain was the recipient of a poor clear at the blue line when he walked into open space at the point and launched a wrist shot into the top right corner. With the goal, Karlsson passed Redden. Mike Condon faced nine shots and was forced to make several quality stops on high percentage scoring chances.  Eight minutes into the second frame, after Karlsson got his hand stuck under Joe Thorntonês armpit, Logan Couture received a pass in the slot and wired a wrister past the outstretched glove of Condon as the power play was ending. During the second period, momentum completely shifted in the Sharksê favour. Shots after two were 19-11 San Jose and continued to get worse for Ottawa in the final frame. Condon was brilliant again in the third period. He also flashed the leather for the highlight of the night. Mere minutes after his outstanding save, Condon would let in a bit of a softy on a Brent Burns shot from distance with a partial screen in front of him. But that was it. That was his only mistake. Then, when all hope was lost, and the Sharks were surely going to break through once more, Chris Kelly was sprung on a breakaway after the puck hopped over two Shark defendersê sticks. With Marc-Edward Vlasic on his tail, Kelly flipped the puck just over Jonesê blocker and the Senators had the lead again. In the final seconds, Jean-Gabriel Pageau threw the puck 100 feet in the air, only to have it roll into the empty net 150 feet down the ice. The Senators had pulled off the ultimate Houdini act. The shots ended 37-17 in favour of the home team. Sens fans could go to bed happy. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson What a night for the captain. Not only did Karlsson record his seventh point in two games, but he made history. Redden will soon be a small, blurry dot in Karlssonês rear view mirror as he continues to climb the franchise lists. Not to mention, all-time NHL lists. Sens Hero: Mike Condon Condon has been everything the Senators couldêve wanted when they picked him up from the Penguins and more. Now 4-1-1 in a Senators uniform, he is clearly the outright No. 2 goaltender in this organization, surpassing Andrew Hammond in a big way. Honourable Mention: Chris Kelly Though The Hockey Gods were definitely on his side tonight, Kelly stepped up when Ottawa desperately needed a goal. One of the biggest plays of the night.  ",Fear the Fin,Sharks drop a tough one after break,"San Jose looked poised to at least force overtime against Ottawa in the teamês only SAP Center meeting this season, but a couple fluky bounces created a one-on-one that the Senators converted on with a minute to go to take a 3-2 lead. The Senators scored on the empty net to shock the Sharks and win 4-2 on Wednesday night.  The Sharks came into tonight's game against the Senators as one of the hottest teams in the NHL (.731 Win Percentage since November 7th) and on four days of rest. The eternal question with hot teams coming back from long breaks remains: Will there be any rust that will affect the hot streak? The Sharks looked rested in terms of having a step on the Senators early but the rust showed up in terms of their team play. They looked lost and couldnêt mount much of an attack, or a defense for that matter, for the better part of the first period. After rebounding strong and outplaying the Senators for the final two-thirds of the game, the early confusion came back to bite San Jose as they dropped the matchup with Ottawa despite out-shooting their opponents 36-15 and racking up six power play opportunities. The Sens opened up the scoring early and often. Shortly after a Tommy Wingels tripping penalty, Mark Stone slid a bouncing puck home from short range past a scrambling Martin Jones at 3:12 in the first period. Three minutes and 37 seconds later Ottawaês uber talented captain, Erik Karlsson, snapped a wrister from between the circles past Jones with the help of a Tom Pyatt screen job. Despite earning two power plays throughout the first period, the Sharks could only muster one shot on goal during each opportunity. Perhaps their best scoring opportunity came shortly after the second power play began: a pileup in Senatorsê goalie Mike condon 's crease resulted in the puck squirting out to Brent Burns who couldnêt squeeze off a solid shot into an unguarded left side of the net.  After assisting on Stoneês first goal and then scoring shortly after Erik Karlsson would take a two point lead over Brent Burns into the first intermission of the battle between the two defensive titans. 36 seconds into the second period the Senators nearly added to their lead but Tom Pyattês short-lived goal was immediately waved off due to a high touch before the puck careened over Jonesê shoulder.  The Sharks finally gained some momentum when Logan Couture slid into the middle of the ice and wristed a slick pass from captain Joe Pavelski over Condonês glove to give the Sharks a power play goal of their own, moving the score to 2-1 and shaving the San Jose deficit to a single goal. Couture didnêt look any worse for the wear after having a screw removed from his ankle over the weekend. Pavelski nearly missed tying the game up after receiving a beautiful cross-neutral zone pass from Brendan Dylan. Pavs glided through the Sens D and attacked Condonês glove side again beating the glove but not the post behind it.  Ottawa came into the game with the fourth-ranked penalty kill in the NHL and tonight they seemed determined to prove how good they were on the PK as they displayed a commitment to taking every penalty in the book throughout the second period. Dion Phaneuf took an interference penalty with 32 seconds remaining in play to give the Senators their fifth of the game heading into the third.  After killing off Phaneufês penalty, Chris Neal racked up his third penalty of the game interfering with Pavelski on a one-timer opportunity at 4:52 into the third and was soon joined by San Joseês Mikkel Boedker who was called for goaltender interference to create a 4-on-4 situation. Not to be outdone by his peer, Erik Karlsson, Brent Burns quickly took over the abbreviated 4-on-4 session. Skating the puck around the offensive zone Burns took a shot from the blue line which created a high bounce off of Condon that Burnsê defensive partner Paul Martin corralled and promptly dished right back to Burns who absolutely ripped a wrister from the top of the right faceoff circle to once again beat Condon over his glove to knot the score up at 2-2, giving Burns and Karlsson both a goal in the contest. The Sharks owned the action until the final two minutes of play when Justin Braun misplayed a puck at his own blue line, allowing the Senatorsê Chris Kelly to just get enough off on a shot that floated over Martin Jonesê left shoulder to put Ottawa up for good 3-2. The Sens would add an empty netter to end the scoring for the night at 4-2.  Fear The Fin 3 Stars Mike Condon Erik Karlsson Brent Burns Honorable Mention: Joe Pavelski  "

His latest goal barely beat the clock and sent Los Angeles to a win in its final home game for three weeks. Lewis had a goal and an assist, and Jeff Carter and Alec Martinez scored on the same power play early in the first period of the Kings' 4-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday. Lewis is a two-time Stanley Cup champion who plays a key supporting role for the Kings, but he has never scored more than nine goals in the NHL. He has five already this season, including a goal with 0.5 seconds left in a second period otherwise dominated by the Senators. ""I've still got it a little bit,"" Lewis said after scoring his third goal in four games, calling it one of his best offensive stretches since his junior career a decade ago. ""Hopefully, I can keep it up. "" Peter Budaj made 19 saves and earned an assist, and Marian Gaborik scored his first goal since Feb. 12 to cap the Kings' final home game before a nine-game stint on the road until New Year's Eve. The Kings seized an early lead after Mark Borowiecki received a 5-minute major for boarding Tyler Toffoli, who went to the dressing room after getting his face driven into the glass. Carter scored his 12th goal early in the power play on a quick wrist shot, and Martinez scored in the final seconds with a long shot that ricocheted off goalie Mike Condon. ""When we get an opportunity to go on the power play for 5 minutes, we've got to take advantage of that,"" Martinez said. ""That situation a few years ago comes to mind. That's why special teams are important. "" Los Angeles famously scored three times during a 5-minute power play in Game 6 of the 2012 Stanley Cup Final at Staples Center, propelling Martinez and the Kings to their first NHL title. Condon stopped 15 shots in the fourth loss in six games for the Senators, who couldn't climb out of the early hole created by the Kings' special teams after Borowiecki ran into Toffoli from behind. ""It's a penalty, for sure,"" Borowiecki said. ""I feel bad about putting our team in that (situation). Never mean to hurt anyone or put anyone in a bad spot, but anyone that plays my brand of hockey is going to have a couple of those a season. "" Zack Smith trimmed the lead early in the second period by ending his 13-game goal drought, but the Senators struggled to beat Budaj in the second stop of their swing through California. Budaj, the former Montreal goalie who rose from the AHL this season to take over for injured Jonathan Quick, even got an assist on Carter's goal for his first point since April 4, 2012. ""We've had success coming back,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said. ""Guys were showing character, and we were doing it, but I think the biggest deflator was the end of the second period. We have to be prepared in those last few seconds. "" Gaborik capped the win in the third period on an exceptional shot. The Slovak wing missed the final two months of last season and the first six weeks of this season with injuries. Veteran forward Chris Neil played his 1,000th game for Ottawa, joining Daniel Alfredsson and Chris Phillips as the only Senators to reach the mark. NOTES: Kings coach Darryl Sutter got his 200th victory with the franchise. Only Andy Murray (215) has more. Asked if the milestone meant anything to him, Sutter replied:""Nope. "" ... Andy Andreoff returned to the Kings' lineup after missing 17 games following an upper-body injury in late October. Devin Setoguchi also was back in the lineup, and the Kings scratched Kyle Cliffordand Nic Dowd, who had played in 24 straight games. ... Borowiecki fought Matt Greene shortly after getting out of the penalty box. Toffoli returned to the ice late in the first period. UP NEXT Senators: At the Anaheim Ducks on Sunday. Kings: At the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday.  ",Callum Fraser,Senators Fall 4-1 to Kings in Chris Neilês 1000th Game,"While the Senators were in Los Angeles for their 28th game of the season, Chris Neil stepped onto the ice for the 1000th time in his career. A feat few have accomplished in the many years of the NHL, it was more than a special day for Neil, his family and the organization. The first period, however, was nothing to honour. Two minutes into the game, Mark Borowiecki barged in from the point and hit a vulnerable Tyler Toffoli from behind, garnering a five-minute major and a heck of a lot of attention from the Kings. Though they boasted the leagueês fifth best penalty kill going into Saturday afternoon, the Senators would give up two whilst a man down. First, Dion Phaneuf made a horrific play in his own zone, bobbling the puck and allowing Jeff Carter to go in all alone, which ultimately ended in Carter chipping one over Mike Condonês glove. And second, Alec Martinez blasted a point shot that Condon stopped with his blocker, but the puck continued on into the air and over the 26-year-oldês head, off his back and into the net.  Borowiecki would finally walk out of the penalty box at the 12-minute mark, but he wouldnêt stay in the play very long as he would have to answer the bell the next play against Matt Greene. The two engaged in quite the spirited bout, Borowiecki getting the better of Greene, but nonentheless, the Senators defenseman was back in the box. And it was only fitting that Neil joined him shortly after.  The feistiness had certainly picked up after Borowieckiês hit and fight, and Jordan Nolan looked to continue the tone of the game with a thunderous and clean hit on Bobby Ryan deep in the Senatorsê end. But like anytime anyone throws a big, clean hit in the NHL nowadays, they must answer the bell, for some reason. Neil skated across the fight, demanded that Nolan drops his gloves, and away they went. Neil would end up winning rather handedly, seeing as Nolan didnêt look that into it. After, the 37-year-old winger gazed over to his teamês bench and motioned for them to get going. In the second frame, they did. Two minutes in, Zack Smith batted a puck out of the air at the Kingsê blue line right on the the stick of Tom Pyatt, who picked it up, drove wide, and found Smith driving the net. The Senators were within one. Smith had his fourth of the year. Ottawa absolutely dominated the play for the rest of the period. Well, for nearly the rest of the period. About to go into the intermission with momentum and a 17-12 lead in the shot category, the Senators were in a great position. Until Trevor Lewis found a loose puck in the slot and buried it past the outstretched glove of Condon with 1.8 seconds left.  During a break later on, Ray Ferraro and the TSN crew pointed out that the clock had started six seconds late in the second period. The timekeepers had only taken off four seconds during the next break, two fewer than they shouldêve. The back-breaker to end all back-breakers. The Senators had work to do. And they wouldnêt be short of opportunities in the final frame. The Kings took two minor penalties in the early stages, but the Senators were unable to capitalize. The Kings would add another goal to make it 4-1 on the only penalty the Senators would take in the third period. An emotionally draining game that couldêve turned out a whole lot differently. Sens Hero: Chris Neil Regardless of how he played, today was an opportunity for the fanbase, league and organization to say thanks to the third player in Senators franchise history to reach the 1000 game mark. So many memorable moments have been produced by his fists and stick; he truly does have his very own spot in the hearts of Sens fans. Sens Zero: Mark Borowiecki Mark Borowiecki started the season off ever so strong. His possession numbers were outstanding, his decision making skills had improved and he was flourishing under Guy Boucherês defensively centred system. But ever since the Senators started to score more and Boucher began to allow the team to be a bit more creative in all zones, Borowiecki has strayed away from that conservative style that benefitted him so greatly in the first month or so of the season. Heês jumping in far too often, overcommitting like last season and itês showing on the ice and on the stat sheet. Ottawa needs their tough, passionate, depth defenseman to be much better. Sens Killer: A Lackluster Power Play & Penalty Kill Before today, the Senatorsê special teams were both trending up in a big way. The power play, though abysmal in the first month or so of the season, had done a giant 180 degree turn and 16th at 16.7%. The penalty kill was top five in the entire league and one of the big reasons the team was second in their division with a rather unfavourable goal differential. That was not the case today, though. The Senators went 0-for-4 on the power play and 1-for-4 on the penalty kill. In the end, special teams won the game for the Kings.  ",Jewels From the Crown,"Clocks, Coulombs, and Controversy, Oh My!","There's a lot to unpack with this game so let's start with some positives: Darryl Sutter got his 200th win with the Los Angeles Kings, the most he's had with any team in his illustrious career while Dean Lombardi picked up his 400th win as General Manager. Sutter is the 53rd bench boss in NHL history to get at least 200 wins with one team, so that's pretty cool. He needs only 16 more to pass Andy Murray as the winningest coach in franchise history. Regardless of what the final score ends up being, the game-winning goal at the very least came off Alec Martinez's stick on the power play. Jeff Carter continues to tap into his new dad powers and started the scoring for the Kings after Mark Borowiecki boarded Tyler Toffoli early in the first period. Thanks to that ref, there was no repeat of what happened to Philip Larsen while Cupcake was down on the ice. Toffoli did leave the game for a while but did return, whereupon he immediately took a penalty. He went from zero penalties in 23 games to four in the last four. This is not a streak anyone wants to see from him. But, fortunately the Kings' penalty kill was up to snuff today as the team managed to kill off all four power plays. Peter Budaj had one of his best starts in a Kings uniform and was excellent when the Senators had the man advantage. His movements were sharp, crisp and efficient with no extra wasted energy, which is nice to see considering his last few games were rather forgettable. Speaking of power plays, the Senators had the 6th best in the league coming into this game but scored no goals in this afternoon's matchup. The Kings, on the other hand, were 28th in the NHL and scored three times, while their 26th ranked penalty kill (Senators were 5th) was perfect. Sometimes hockey is weird. But this is a good weird that everyone will take every single time. Scorers for Los Angeles include Carter, Martinez and Marian Gaborik. Trevor Lewis had the team's only even-strength goal and it's hotly contest by the Sens because of coulombs! Yes, folks, as Eric wrote earlier, there was another malfunction with the clock and Ottawa is claiming that the time was off, thereby allowing Lewis to score with less than seconds left in the period. Being that this is the Kings, that wasn't the only odd thing to happen in that period. Chris Neilwas initially assessed a slashing penalty after he broke Nick Shore's stick. The television broadcast went to commercial, the player went to the box and everyone assumed the Kings would have a power play. Except, as the broadcast returned from break, Neil was skating back to the bench. Wait, what? According to Sean O'Donnell, one apparent eagle-eyed linesman determined that Shore's stick was broken before Neil slashed it. Therefore, it's not a penalty. You said it, Helene. Jean-Gabriel Pageau got the Senators' lone goal, though not for lack of trying. Cody Ceci had three shots in the first period and the visitors really controlled the entire middle frame. In the final 20 minutes, the guys in black and grey and gold piping actually came back to life. As the seconds ticked away, Tanner Pearson got on his horse and hustled to draw a penalty. Despite there not being any shot on net before Gaborik's eventual goal, it was probably one of their best kicks at the can up to that point. The passing was smooth, the team did a good job of keeping the puck in and just moving around well. Gaborik's first goal of the season could not have been much prettier. Nice screen in front by Dustin Brown, too. "

Vermette and Corey Perry each had a goal and an assist, and the Anaheim Ducks scored a season-high three power play goals to beat the Ottawa Senators 5-1 on Sunday afternoon. Joseph Cramarossa, Sami Vatanen and Vermette's linemate Nick Ritchiealso scored for the Ducks, and John Gibson made 21 saves. ""He's a dominant center iceman with the puck and that's a huge advantage,"" Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said of Vermette, his third-line center. ""And we like to play into that.

Hammond made 16 saves. ""Trying to get something and give Hammond some ice time, too,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""We had Condon starting the game, we wanted to see what it would look like to get him in on a back-to-back. If our players were in the game and we're playing very good, with the same score I probably would have done something different. But I saw right away that our guys just weren't in this game. "" Boucher lamented the team's lack of effort the day after a 4-1 loss in Los Angeles. ""It was a no-show all around. Not good,"" Boucher said. ""We wanted to rebound from yesterday. We played a hard game yesterday and it didn't turn out our way but we didn't give much to the opponent and played a physical game. Today, we didn't play a physical game at all. "" The 34-year-old Vermette facilitated Ritchie's goal with a beautiful backhand pass into the slot at 10:29 in the second period, giving the Ducks a 4-1 lead - 21-year-old linemate Ondrej Kase also assisted on the tally. Vermette capitalized on the power play with 47 seconds left in the first period to make it 3-1. ""Nothing too special,"" Vermette said. ""We want to create some shooting lanes with good positioning, we have our setup and good players on the team. It's a matter of executing and eventually the puck goes in. Tonight was one of those nights. "" Vatanen closed the scoring with a power-play goal off the crossbar at 7:59 in the third period. Perry scored his first power-play goal of the season at 12:05 in the first to break a 1-1 tie. Perry has scored twice in the last three games after going 18 games without a goal. Dzingel scored at 7:53 in the first when he finished off a feed from the corner boards by Bobby Ryan, momentarily tying the game at 1-1. Cramarossa scored on a rebound 2:58 into play to give the Ducks a 1-0 lead. ""We wanted to have a strong first period, give ourselves a chance with a good strong start,"" Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said. ""Get our skating game going, get our forechecking game going. Then we can build on it the rest of the game. "" The Ducks have won three in a row at Honda Center. ""We had a pretty strong homestand up until this point, and we wanted to win another one before hitting the road,"" Ritchie said. ""That's a big win for us heading out for a six-game road trip.

UP NEXT Senators: Return home to host the Sharks on Wednesday. Ducks: Open a six-game road trip in Dallas on Tuesday.  ",Callum Fraser,Senators Finish Road Trip with 5-1 Loss in Anaheim,"In the final leg of their West Coast Swing, the Senators needed a win in Anaheim to be able to call the four-game road trip anything close to a success. After big losses in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, and an unconvincing win in San Jose, either they were running out of gas a third of the way through Deathcember or they simply werenêt as good as their record suggested. The Senators were rather comfortable in second place in the Atlantic Division - Boston and Tampa Bay had lost the night before, giving Ottawa an opportunity to create a gap - but still sat only two points clear of ninth. After the Ducks scored an early goal, the Senators got a chance on the man advantage. Though their first unit was unsuccessful, Bobby Ryan and Ryan Dzingel teamed up for a beautiful play that ended with Dzingel hammering home a one-timer. Dzingel had his seventh of the year and Ryan had his first point in five games. The past couple weeks saw Ottawa pad their special teams stats and move up the rankings, but a horrific performance in Los Angeles had them struggling as of late. The power play seemed alright, but the penalty kill looked to be troublesome. First it was Corey Perry who took advantage of a preoccupied Dion Phaneuf, jamming home a rebound while the Senators defenseman was busy with trying to jab Perry in the mid section. Then Antoine Vermette was the beneficiary of some poor coverage by Cody Ceci as the Senators allowed two cross ice passes, getting Condon to move completely out of position. Vermette would bank one in off Ceciês foot and it was 3-1. Condon made some fantastic saves in the first period, facing 13 shots, many of them high quality chances, but he was pulled in favour of Andrew Hammond to begin the second period. The defensive blunders continued in the second frame.  Halfway through the period, Phaneuf got caught pinching, Hoffman got beat in the neutral zone, Vermette found a seam on a 3-on-1 and Nick Ritchie put the puck past Andrew Hammondês blocker side for his seventh of the year. The Ducks seemed to carry the play throughout the first forty minutes, outshooting the Senators 25-14 and really not allowing too many scoring chances. It definitely felt like a Sunday afternoon at the end of a road trip. In the final frame, there were plenty of opportunities for the away team to get back in the game. The Ducks took three penalties, all which the Senators failed to capitalize on. And when Ottawa couldnêt get back in the game, the Ducks put it away for good. After Chris Kelly took a high-sticking penalty, Sami Vatanen chipped a rebound over Hammondês glove and it was 5-1. And with that, the exhausting, deflating, taxing road trip was over. Sens Hero: Ryan Dzingel Dzingel had the Senatorsê only goal, but his impact on this game was far larger than that. When it seemed like the team simply wasnêt up for it, Dzingel led rushes, drove the net and created scoring chances with his speed and skill. Sens Zero: Dion Phaneuf Itês usually not a good night when youêre on the ice for four of the five goals scored against your team. Phaneuf failed to do one of the things heês best at: protect the net. The Senators were not at all successful defending their crease on the penalty kill, and Phaneuf was front and centre for three of them.  Sens Killers: Antoine Vermette and Corey Perry While the pair of them combined for four points, Vermette and Perry both made multiple plays that helped seal the victory for the Ducks. In the end, Anaheimês gamebreakers came out to play and Ottawaês did not.  ",,,

On Tuesday night in Toronto, Logan Couture scored the only goal in a shootout in the Sharks' 3-2 victory over the Maple Leafs. Bobby Ryan, Kyle Turris and Dion Phaneuf scored for the Senators, and Mke Condon stopped 26 shots. Ottawa has lost three straight, its longest losing streak of the season. ""It's definitely a solid game,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher. ""We had a lot of character. ... We showed the players were dedicated and they wanted to pay the price and they wanted to be better than our previous game. "" Ottawa was without Turris for much of the third as he sat in the penalty box after being handed a 10-minute misconduct at 19:40 of the second. Marc-Edouard Vlasic got tangled up with captain Erik Karlsson and appeared to spear him late in the second period. Turris went after Vlasic and ended up with a minor penalty for instigating, a major for fighting and a 10-minute misconduct. ""I'm down in the corner battling and I lose my stick and the play is gone and I'm reaching for it and he tries to pitchfork me in the face and I'm lucky that I'm looking down,"" Karlsson said. ""As far as I'm concerned that's a dangerous play. It's intentional and I've got to give it to Turris for sticking up for me. "" Sharks coach Peter DeBoer said he had no update on Couture. ""It's the way it is sometimes, emotions get high,"" Sharks forward Joe Thornton said. ""Hopefully, (Couture) is OK. I haven't seen him yet. It's an emotional game, what can I say.

NOTES: The Senators recognized Chris Neil before the game for playing 1,000 NHL games. Neil is the third player in Senators franchise history to reach the milestone. ""It was an emotional night for me,"" admitted Neil. ""(The team) were all behind me doing their hardest to get the two points. "" ...

They will finish the four-game trip Sunday at Chicago. Senators: Host New Jersey on Saturday night.  ",Trevor Shackles,Senators Unable to Finish off the Sharks in a 4-3 Shootout Loss,"Coming off of an ugly road trip that saw the Senators take 2 of 8 points and allow 19 goals, Ottawa was looking to get back on track at home against the same team they played a week ago: the San Jose Sharks.  They had a much better effort at the Canadian Tire Centre tonight, although they ultimately came up just short. As is the story most nights, Ottawa would allow the first goal of the game. Although they did not technically allow a goal on the penalty kill, there were four players in their zone when Joe Pavelski put the Sharks up one.  With Logan Couture getting a pass in front of the net, nobody knew Pavelski was wide open back-door, except for Couture who had the puck. Mike Condon had no chance on the play and there was no way Pavelski was going to miss from that close.  Just a few minutes later though, Ottawa was able to even things up. There has been a lot of talk about how much Bobby Ryan has been struggling this season, and the game against Anaheim on Sunday just made things worse because of people bringing up the Ryan/Silfverberg trade.  So naturally, it was good to see Ryan score a goal tonight off of a quick wrist shot after a great feed by Ryan Dzingel from behind the net. That goal was just Ryanês 4th of the year. San Jose took the lead again when Brent Burns made Ben Harpur look incredibly flat-footed. It was almost as if Harpur didnêt even try to turn and angle him off to the corner. Alas, Ottawaês leading goal scorer Kyle Turris made sure that they wouldnêt go into the 2nd intermission down by one. After Mike Hoffman kept the puck in the offensive zone and put it in the corner, Mark Stone made a brilliant pass across the slot to an open Turris, who fired it home to cap off an aesthetically pleasing play.   Then at the end of the period, things got a bit heated:  Vlasicês spear on Karlsson get Turris riled up, which resulted in him getting 2 minutes for instigating, 5 for fighting, and a 10 minute misconduct. Vlasic received a 5 for fighting, but nothing else. Safe to say the team and the fans were not too pleased. This is the best replay I could find:  After two periods, the score was tied but the Senators were actually playing quite well, with the shot attempts being equal, and they had some good looks on the power play. The third period would only get more interesting, as the two teams traded one more goal each, the Sharks had a disallowed goal, and Hoffman received a 5-minute major (and a possible suspension) on a dirty play.  Iêm worried that Hoffman will get supplemental discipline, because it does not look pretty: Eesh. San Joseês disallowed goal was just barely offside, so Ottawa caught on enormous break on the play. After that, the Senators actually had the lead with 3:46 to go thanks to a Dion Phaneuf power play goal. At that point, it looked like theyêd be able to cruise to a regulation win. However, Chris Tierney tied it with only 2:28 left, and sent the game to overtime.  Overtime did not produce a ton of chances like it normally can, but the final minute of play was nerve-racking after Ottawa took a too many men penalty. Fortunately, Condon made a few saves and they sent it to the shootout.  The first three shooters on both sides could not score, and that meant Guy Boucher went to his 4th shooter: Chris Neil. He made a move by banking the puck off his skate, and if it had worked, people would have been talking about it for a while. But it wasnêt quite done to perfection, and Neil missed. That set up rookie Kevin Labanc for a chance to give San Jose the win, and thatês exactly what he did. The final score, San Jose 4, Ottawa 3 in a shootout.  Sens Almost Hero: Chris Neil How perfect would it have been if he had scored the shootout winner? Tonight was his night, and fans would have been sent home happy. Having said that, sending him out as the 4th shooter was way too early, and I certainly wasnêt a fan of it. Of course if he had scored, I wouldnêt be able to complain, but it was a risky move nonetheless.  Even though he didnêt score, he is still a hero to thousands of people that came out to see him tonight anyway. Congrats on 1000 games, Neil. Sens Honourable Mention: Mark Stone I donêt like giving out _heroesÓ in a loss, so Stone gets an honourable mention. He racked up another two assists tonight, and he continues to play excellent. This past month or so he has been playing like the player we all know he can be, so at least there is that going for the Senators. Sens Zero: Ben Harpur Look, I know heês not the first defenseman Ottawa wants to call up, but...He should not be in the NHL. Iêd even rather have someone like Mike Kostka because at least heês played some games at this level. Sure heês big, but he absolutely cannot keep up, and the Sharks arenêt even known for their speed. Sens Killer: Brent Burns The man can flat-out play. He is dangerous every single time he has the puck, and he certainly reminds me of Erik Karlsson. Itês almost impossible to keep him off the scoresheet, and the Senators were unable to do so, as he recorded one goal, one assist, and six shots.  ",Fear the Fin,Sharks deposit mediocre narratives in back-to-back nights,"San Jose didnêt seize its most obvious opportunities in its wins over the Toronto Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators on Tuesday and Wednesday night, respectively. The Sharks got oodles of chances on the man-advantage and while they scored once on the power play against the Leafs and practically did the same against the Senators, greater chances went begging.  The Sharksê let a golden opportunity slip through their fingers midway through the third period on Wednesday after Mike Hoffman checked Logan Couture in the back of the head. A five-minute major penalty should have been all the Sharks needed to put the game to bed. Instead, Ottawa   a team that does not excel at penalty killing   survived.  To make matters worse, San Jose put itself in the box time and again, seemingly convinced it needed to lose this game. At some point these wasted opportunities had to come back to bite them, right? After all, this lack of jump or energy needed to be punished by some almighty hockey god up in the heavens, right?  Not quite. Whatês most remarkable about the more religious aspects of the NHL is the accompanying ignorance. We see what we want to see, after all. Stat nerds made up correlation vs. causation and deciding the Sharksê power play is broken based on the last 15 games is a reasonable thing to say because, shit, I dunno, why not?  Chris Tierney and Kevin Labanc had other ideas last night. Tierney corralled a rebound and delivered it past Mike Condon to help the Sharks towards winning a game they probably shouldnêt have won. Thatês fine with me, particularly given the way the last meeting with the Senators went down. Plus, Hoffman might have killed Couture, so San Jose deserved this one.  The last narrative dagger was a little more fun. Chris Neil, noted goon and beloved in the city of Ottawa, played in his 1,000th NHL game this weekend against the Los Angeles Kings. Whatês most remarkable about this feat is that heês not been suspended a single time in his NHL career; that says more about the incompetence of the NHL than his actions as a player, of course, but itês amazing nonetheless.  He celebrated those accomplishments by taking a stupid penalty and then getting called on in the shootout. Martin Jones saved his weak shot while laughing before Labanc, a rookie, showed Neil up. There arenêt any hockey gods, but sometimes the dice smile upon us.  "

Derick Brassard scored the go-ahead goal early in the second period, Mike Condon stopped 29 shots and the Ottawa Senators beat the Devils 3-1 on Saturday night to snap a season-high three-game losing streak. Bobby Ryan scored in the first period and Zack Smith added an empty-netter for the Senators. However, everyone was talking about Borowiecki after the game. For about 30 seconds midway through the third period the Devils controlled the puck in the Ottawa zone while Borowiecki stumbled and fell about five times after losing his skate blade. Referee Tim Peel finally blew the play dead allowing Borowiecki to make his way to the bench and get his skate repaired. ""It was a very serious moment in the game and (the Devils) were throwing the puck around and then I saw (Borowiecki) fall and I couldn't help but chuckle when he fell on his butt so hard,"" Condon said. ""I talked to the ref after and he said `that's not hockey and I had to blow the whistle.' Thankfully he blew it down. "" Borowiecki also had a postgame laugh about the incident and said it was the second pair of skates he broke in the game. ""My blade holder cracked in half and I lost my steel and when that happens you can't stand up. It's impossible,"" he said. ""I'm pretty sure I have two bruised hip bones right now from falling so much. You can laugh about it now. (Chris Kelly) said Timmy Peel was so disgusted with me on that shift he just finally blew it down. "" John Moore scored and Keith Kinkaid finished with 28 saves for the Devils, who have lost five straight. The Senators entered the third period up 2-1 and needed a great save from Condon in the final minute before Smith scored into the empty net with 14 seconds to play. Despite borowiecki 's moment of comedic misfortune, Senators coach Guy Boucher thought his club played a textbook third period - not allowing the Devils to score while holding them to six shots. ""Winning teams, that's what they're able to do,"" Boucher said. ""I like that twice we took away back doors, which has hurt us lately. I really like that we had a back door, box up mentality. ""(Cody) Ceci saved one, (Dion) Phaneuf saved one, our forwards were really looking for that back-door guy, so I think we got better. It was a solid, shutdown third period. "" Ottawa went up 2-1 at 1:14 of the second period when Brassard tipped a shot by Zack Smith past Kinkaid. That goal was changed after originally being credited to Smith. The Devils nearly tied the game a few minutes later when Taylor Hall beat Condon with a shot from the slot, but after hitting the post the puck was swept away by Dion Phaneuf. The Senators got the game's first goal four minutes in thanks to a little leg work from Smith. Chris Kelly took a shot that was redirected by the knee of Ryan in front of Kinkaid. Kelly was originally credited with the goal but following further review it was changed to Ryan. The Devils tied the game just shy of the 11-minute mark of the first period when Moore beat Condon with a point shot. Mike Cammalleri picked up the assist on the goal, giving him his 600th NHL point. ""You hit a milestone and it gives you a moment to reflect,"" Cammalleri said. ""I'm a romanticist when it comes to sports and it for me it makes me think of all the people that support you and all the time you've enjoyed playing this game. ""But it's only a moment of reflection because you get right back to trying to win a hockey game.

",Ary M,"Sens end three game skid by vanquishing the Devils, 3-1","Coming into tonightês game, the Sens and Devils were both reeling with losing streaks of three and four games respectively, and thus, I was expecting a close, tight-checking game like the two teams always play. However, this game was far from typical, despite the 3 - 1 score. In fact, the Devils team speed was evident and the game was played at a fast pace all night   ending with 97 shot attempts. The Sens were lucky to be up against backup Çtender Keith Kinkaid as the Devils were also in a back-to-back situation. Surprisingly, the Devils had enough skill (?) so that players like Beau Bennett, Pavel Zacha, and P.A. Parenteau were all healthy scratches.  The night started with a bang, with call-up Casey Baileyês witnessing a fight during his first NHL shift of the season as linemate Chris Neil and Devils enforcer Luke Gazdic dropped the gloves right off the bat. The commentators remarked that Neil and Gazdic were chirping each other all through warm-ups, so this was likely something brewing. The Sens also got off on the right foot where it counts, too, with a mismatched line of Bobby Ryan, Chris Kelly, and Ryan Dzingel going to work in the Devils zone. After Ryan entered the Devils zone and skated to the middle of the ice, the puck took a couple of bounces and found its way to Chris Kelly. With no other play, Kelly made the correct decision to fire it on net, and low and behold, something good happened! The puck ends up bouncing off Ryanês skate and past Kinkaid, giving Ryan his first three-game point streak of the season.  The Devils responded a couple of minutes later, with a strong forecheck causing Jean-Gabriel Pageau to make a poor defensive play   reversing the puck to no one low in the offensive zone. The puck ends up on the stick of Mike Cammalleri, who was dangerous all night on route to a 75% CF%, and he wastes no time taking the puck to the front of the net. It eventually bounces to Devils D John Moore at the high slot, who sneaks a shot through a bunch of bodies and five-hole past Condon. The Sens actually challenged the call for goaltender interference, perhaps remembering a similar play where a Chris Neil goal got overturned in Buffalo, but ended up on the losing side again. Taylor Hall does appear to hit Condonês glove on the fly-by, but itês determined that it didnêt impede Condon from making the save on Mooreês shot.  The second period started much like the first for the Sens   with a goal. After some great puck protection up high by Smith on the entry and Mark Stone later on, Smith ends up building speed down the left side and firing a quick shot Kinkaidês way. Derrick Brassard, elusive in front of the net, manages to get his stick on it and redirect it past Kinkaid for a 2 - 1 Sens lead. The Devils major excitement of the period came off of their lone powerplay, generated by the net front presence of rookie Miles Wood. The Sens managed to get the kill, but I donêt think it was due to skill. New Jersey fired six pucks towards goal, including one by Taylor Hall that beats Mike Condon, but is cleared off the goal line by Dion Phaneuf.  After 77 shot attempts after 2 periods, the game really settled down in the third, with the Sens having a run without a shot on goal against in the first 7:27 of the period. In total, there were only 20 shot attempts in the entire period   a stat thatês bound to make Guy Boucher happy after the Senators have struggled recently with the checking game that got them a lot of points to start the season.  That doesnêt mean that there wasnêt any action, as the physical play definitely picked up. Miles Wood, being a rookie, does not yet know the _donêt touch KarlssonÓ rule, and although the Sens werenêt able to get him back like Turris on Vlasic on Wednesday night, Methot paid the Devils back by standing up Taylor Hall at centre ice. The best part of all of this? Methotês clean hit generated a powerplay for the Senators, as Lappin tried to instigate a fight and instead, takes a double-minor on the play compared to Methotês two minutes for roughing.  The funniest moment of the game (in hindsight, of course) came near the end when Mark Borowiecki lost his skate blade. Instead of sliding to the bench, Boro tried to play through his shift for ~40 seconds and fell about 7 times until referee Chris Lee stopped the play due to risk of injury   the first time Iêve seen that called. On the bench, Erik Karlsson was shown laughing. Mike Condon was strong all night, turning away 29 of 30 shots including a beautiful cross-crease stop on Travis Zajac with the Devils net empty. His heroics set up Chris Kellyês determination, as the veteran forward muscled the puck out of the defensive zone and eventually, onto the puck of Zack Smith, who potted the empty netter for his second point of the night. Playing in the top-six in lieu of the suspended Mike Hoffman, Smith played one of the best games of the season tonight with Derrick Brassard and Mark Stone on route to a 67% CF%.  Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson The Sens captain skated the team out of trouble multiple times tonight. He didnêt get a point, but was on the ice for almost 30% of the Sens shot attempts and made multiple stellar defensive plays like the one below. Sens Killers: The Devils Top-Six Mike Condon and Guy Boucher highlighted the Devils team speed pre-game, and itês safe to say that they were right. In particular, 21yo Miles Wood, a player with Colin Whiteês Boston College last season, was extremely impressive tonight. He was extremely fast on the forecheck, using his speed right off the bat to generate a scoring chance 10 seconds in and got in the face of Erik Karlsson 2-3 times. Via Corsica, the Devils #1 trio of Cammalleri, Zajac, and Hall were +13 in shot attempts tonight, generally preying on the Phaneuf - Ceci pairing.. Sens Killer: Cody Ceci #Sens got hemmed in their zone multiple times tonight, often with Ceci caught up the ice. Now, Iêm fine with Ceci leading the rush because his legs are his best trait, but unlike Miles Wood, he doesnêt appear to know how to use his speed effectively. This leads to ineffective decisions in protecting and managing the puck, and team-low shot attempt numbers. With tonightês 3 - 1 win, the Sens now hold the second spot in the Atlantic division and are two points ahead of the third-place Bruins with a game in hand. They play Sunday night against John Tavares, Shane Prince, and the New York Islanders.  ",All About the Jersey,New Jersey Devils Deflected by Ottawa Senators in Fifth Straight Loss,"Honestly, the New Jersey Devils played their best game of hockey tonight since their last win, which was back on December 6. They actually attacked the Ottawa Senators. They made their goaltender, Mike Condon, make tough saves. The Devils even played to the score for stretches of tonightês game, something they really have not done this season. But improved efforts donêt guarantee improved results. The Devils lost to the Senators, 1-3, for their fifth straight loss in a row. The killer goals were off deflections; hence, the headline. The gameês first goal came early (3:59 into the game) and with the worst kind of a deflection: from their own teammate. Chris Kelly was appropriately covered but managed to get a shot off. It hit Bobby Ryan before getting definitively deflected past Keith Kinkaid by Kyle Quincey. The Devils did have an answer for that goal when John Moore slid in a low shot through traffic off a loose puck in the high slot. Early in the second period, another deflection against. Three opportunities to clear the zone didnêt happen and so Zach Smith collected the puck on the right side. He took a shot and Derrick Brassard stretched his stick to tip it past Kinkaid to make it 1-2. This was 1:14 into the second period. Unfortunately, the Devils did not find an answer for that one. Smith sealed the game with an empty net goal.  The Devils tried to find an answer. After four games where theyêve been dominated for the better parts of games and often in the second period, the Devils were at least competitive. They out-shot the Sens in the second period 14-9. They out-attempted the Sens 20-16. They drew a foul for a power play, which yielded a deflection by Nick Lappin that hit the post and kept the puck just away from the line. They played like a team down a goal in a period where they looked like minor leaguers in recent games. There was that. The third period did not have as many shots - only seven - but they had some great chances. Mike Cammalleri hit the side of the net on a weakside shot I thought Condon somehow robbed him on. Travis Zajac was robbed at the end of the game. The Devils kept making attempts, but they just would not go. Sad as it may seem, it really was an improvement over the last four games.  Ultimately, the Senators just had enough blocks, Condon made the stops, and the Devils just did not have enough go well enough. On its own, in the perspective of an 82-game season, you just chalk this up as a game that didnêt go your way, shrug, and move on. As part of a losing streak, it is a much larger loss than what it is. Every error, no matter how small it may be, just seems that much larger. It felt at times that the streak could be over tonight, or at least the Devils would get some kind of result. That it didnêt happen adds to the frustration that has already been built up with the last four losses. It wasnêt a bad performance at all by the Devils, but I can understand any unhappiness that this was another loss. The Game Stats:  The NHL.com Game Summary | The NHL.com Event Summary | The NHL.com Play by Play Log | The NHL.com Shot Summary | The NHL.com Shift Charts | The Natural Stat Trick Game Stats | The HockeyStats.ca Game Stats The Opposition Opinion:  Ary M has this recap up at Silver Seven. Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes:  If you really want to point a finger at someone for this loss, then I suggest it should be head coach John Hynes. While the Devils have played a better game than they did in nearly two weeks, they were hampered by the roster before the game started. Sure, I did like the move to have Cammalleri, Zajac, and Taylor Hall together. It was a very good and effective move. But I hated, hated, hated, the decision to scratch Beau Bennett and P.A. Parenteau again along with Pavel Zacha. Yes, Zacha, Sergey Kalinin, and Nick Lappin all stunk on Thursday but Zacha was the only one sitting for it. Yes, Luke Gazdic played again. Yes, Jacob Josefson returned to the lineup after seven straight games as a scratch. OK, maybe the last one was understandable. The result? Josefson and Kalinin got owned in the run of play. Lappin was a little better. After a run of games where Vernon Fiddler, Lappin, and Kalinin were an effective depth line, it isnêt helpful to see them constantly on defense. Gazdic had his totally not-at-all-pre-planned fight with Chris Neil that sparked nothing, he had a shot on net, and he played just 5:18 so the Devils were effectively down to eleven forwards. Without Bennett, Parenteau, and Zacha, the _skillÓ at forward was effectively held on the top two lines. So whenever they werenêt playing, the Devils were having issues and Ottawa took advantage. While the Devils put up thirty shots on net and the Zajac line ran through Ottawa for the most part, maybe the addition of one (or all) of those three could have made a difference tonight. The bottom six was a weakpoint, Gazdic didnêt add any actual spark or whatever nonsense people spout about players like him, and the Devils essentially lost a close game while not playing their best possible lineup. (Aside: This game also couldêve helped with Yohann Auvitu in the back than Jon Merrill, who at least had a quiet, steady game.) Then there was the tactical portion. Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump. Sure, some of those dump and chases did work for New Jersey. Yes, Miles Wood can chase down and negate icings (he did at least two of those). But this was a game where both teams were working hard to win the puck and many passes and shots were tipped, blocked, and went awry. It is inherently foolish to just throw pucks away and spend that effort trying to retrieve it instead of making plays with it. Hall was New Jerseyês best skater tonight and he was making a point of carrying the puck in or playing someone else into Ottawaês end. That led to plenty of offensive opportunities for New Jersey. That was not a coincidence. I can understand the dump and change, but there were too many breakouts that ended with a Devil getting to the red line or just before the blueline and throwing the puck into the end boards. That I saw this when the Devils had an extra skater tells me that this was part of the game plan. They need to get away from it because it limits what they can do. In a one-shot game, that limit can be costly and it was to a degree tonight. I can appreciate the improved effort and the generally better performance tonight. I cannot appreciate the coachês roster decisions and tactical decisions for this one. Iêm not saying it would have led to a win, but it could have changed the teamês fortunes.  Kinkaid Did His Best:  Keith Kinkaid had a very good game. He was beaten by two deflections. Thereês not a whole lot any goaltender could do about those goals other than just hope they get in its way. He was very alert, especially in a more free-flowing first period where the Senators put up fifteen shots on net. There were a couple of scrambles, including one in the third period after the defense didnêt clean up a rebound from a Curtis Lazar shot. But Kinkaid was fine. He did enough to give his team an opportunity to succeed.  Should he play tomorrow? Iêm not a fan of starting the same goalie in back-to-back sets to begin with. Kinkaid didnêt exactly have an easy sixty minutes either. He faced thirty shots out of fifty-two attempts. He had a good nightês work; I fear he may be tired for a game in Manhattan against the high-powered New York offense. Thatês just how I see it. I also saw Thursdayês game and concluded that Gazdic should be nowhere near this team, but he played so what do I know? The Fast Wood: Miles Wood continues to impress with his speed. And Adam Henrique and Kyle Palmieri each contributed with him. Henrique had four shots on net and Palmieri had two. I like that Wood can use his speed to get behind the defense. I like that heês willing to go to the _dirty areasÓ (he was high-sticked while screening Condon, leading to a Devils power play). I do hope the Devils plan to use it a little more effectively than to just chase pucks. Even when he wins those races, heês usually not in a position to shoot the puck. He needs to have support to turn that success into further success. I really, really liked his two-on-one with Henrique in the first period. Iêd like more of that. His partner, well, Quincey stunk in the first period but was less stinky as the game went on.  A Defensive Change:  Ben Lovejoy played more with Andy Greene while Damon Severson skated more with Jon Merrill. Iêm not sure if this switch really worked. Severson hasnêt had a great run of games. He was OK overall, I guess? Lovejoy had a rough time of it at times; but Ottawa did not forecheck as much so he at least was not pressured at times. It just seemed like shuffling chairs on a sinking ship as the blueline allowed thirty shots again. I will say I liked John Moore on offense. In addition to his goal, he had three additional shots on net and he did not get caught too deep on offense or unaware going back on defense. I could be a little more forgiving of his defensive issues with more offensive performances like tonight.  A Poor Decision:  In the third period with under six minutes left in regulation, Cody Ceci hit Hall in the neutral zone. Nick Lappin took it upon himself to grab Ceci from behind, drop his gloves, and turn around Ceci for Ceci to throw down his gloves. The officials intervened before a punch was thrown so both were penalized for roughing. But because Lappin started it, they gave him an extra minor for roughing. That meant Ottawa had a power play late in the third period while the Devils were down 1-2. The Devils did a very good job killing it, but it was two minutes where the Devils couldêve went on offense and did not. Lappin didnêt need to start something over what was a legal check. It was a poor decision by the rookie. The Sens that Counted:  While their goals on Kinkaid were off tips, the line of Brassard, Smith, and Mark Stone caused the most issues for the Devils. They attacked much more than they defended. Additionally, Erik Karlsson had his requisite multiple shots on net and positive driving of play while playing a lot of ice time. While he only played a little bit, Lazar was a real sparkplug with four shots on net in less than twelve minutes of ice time. Of course, Condon was the difference maker. He made plenty of stops and while he had to look behind himself a few times, he did a very good job holding onto pucks. Alas, he was only beaten once.  Milestone: Cammalleri picked up an assist on Mooreês goal. That assist was his 600th NHL point.  One Last Thought:  The Devils will play Our Hated Rivals tomorrow. Iêm hoping this is the start of something better rather than a repeat of last weekês nightmare.  "

Mark Stone had a goal and two assists, Zack Smith scored twice and the Senators beat the New York Islanders 6-2 Sunday night. Bobby Ryan, Derick Brassard and Tom Pyatt also scored to help Ottawa win for the second time in two nights. ""This is a back-to-back where we traveled, where we get to bed at 3:30 in the morning and we come here and we win,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""We were playing a very patient game. "" Andrew Hammond started and stopped all seven shots he faced before leaving with 3:15 left in the first period due to an apparent injury. Mike Condon replaced him and had 18 saves the rest of the way. Anders Lee and Anthony Beauvillier scored for New York, which has lost five straight and sits in last place in the Eastern Conference at 11-14-6. Only Colorado (23) and Arizona (27) have fewer points. ""It's a frustrating game,"" Travis Hamonic said. ""It needs to be a better effort through the end of the game. Right there for the taking again. "" Jean-Francois Berube made 27 saves in his second straight start for the Islanders. The third-string goalie was victimized by some bad fortune and some defensive breakdowns. Stone scored the tiebreaking goal to put the Senators up 3-2 with 4:57 left in the second period. It came just 56 seconds after Beauvillier had tied it and was the eighth power-play goal the Islanders have allowed in the last five games. ""When your special teams is at the bottom of the league and your goaltending is not kicking where it was last year, it's a recipe for a losing streak,"" Islanders coach Jack Capuano said. ""Just look at the teams that were high in the standings at the start and look where they are now. It's all correlated. ... We have to fix (those units).

New York had a chance to tie the game late in the period, as Shane Princefired a slap shot that caused Hammond to contort his body before diving to knock the puck away. The Ottawa goaltender sustained a leg injury on the play and left the game. He returned to Ottawa's bench early in the second period. ""It's never good to come in especially when a guy gets hurt and when I saw (Hammond) make that move, right away I knew that was something pretty serious,"" Condon said. ""Hopefully he can get back quick. "" Smith deflected stone 's point shot to push the lead to 2-0 with 2:40 to go in the opening period.

",Michaela Schreiter,Ottawa Senators defeat New York Islanders 6-2 despite early goaltender injury,"The Ottawa Senators wrapped up weekend back-to-back games by visiting Brooklyn to face the New York Islanders on Sunday night. Andrew Hammond got his first start in net since October, but that wouldnêt last long (more on that later). Coming off a much-needed win against New Jersey on Saturday night, the Sens hoped to continue their momentum in Sunday nightês game.  1st Period Overall, the first half of the opening period was rather uneventful. Dion Phaneuf took an interference penalty, but the Sens managed to kill it off without much trouble. The best scoring chance came just as Phaneuf was getting back on the ice, when Nikolai Kulemin almost snuck one past Hammond at the side of the net. Hammond was able to make the stop, leaving the game scoreless.  The first goal of the game came courtesy of Bobby Ryanês elbow, after he tipped in a shot from Kyle Turris on a three-on-one break for Ottawa. Despite needing some ice for his arm, Ryan was probably happy to continue his scoring streak, picking up his third goal in as many games.  New York made things interesting with a few decent chances shortly after Ottawaês first goal. Ryan Strome tested Andrew Hammond with a wrist shot from the hashmarks. Moments later, Erik Karlsson accidentally passed the puck directly to Alan Quine, who quickly fired it at Hammond. Shane Prince even had a great opportunity to score on his former team. Fortunately, Hammond was able to stand tall. But it all seemed to be going too well for the Ottawa goaltender.  After the puck trickled past him and through the crease, Hammond turned around to recover it. In doing this, he went down in obvious pain and would have trouble getting back up. He was forced to leave the game with what looked like a knee injury. Mike Condon stepped in to continue in net for Ottawa.  The Sens responded to the goalie change in the right way. Zack Smith scored his second goal of the weekend, by tipping in a shot from the point by Mark Stone. Karlsson bobbled the puck at the blue line, but managed to slide it to Stone, who fired a shot towards the net. Smith was there to redirect it past Jean-Francois Berube. The first period would end at 2-0 for Ottawa.  2nd Period Of course, the 2-0 lead would prove to be dangerous for the Sens. Less than one minute into the second period, Anders Lee scored his 10th goal of the season, putting the Islanders on the board. Josh Bailey intercepted a pass from Dion Phaneuf, and sent the puck to Lee, who easily beat Condon.  Shortly after his teamês first goal, Cal Clutterbuck took an interference penalty, giving the Sens their first power play of the game. It wasnêt until after he left the box that things got interesting. As Clutterbuckês penalty expired, he found himself on a two-on-one break with John Tavares(which is pretty much the dream for any hockey player). Despite an open net, and a few juicy rebounds, Mike Condon and the Sens managed to keep the puck out of the net.  New York would tie things up with just under five minutes remaining in the period. Travis Hamonic sprung Anthony Beauvillier on a break away, who beat Condon. It seems the 2-0 lead really was as dangerous as it looked.  Have no fear, Sens fans. Mark Stone is here. A mere minute later, Stone picked up the puck on a rebound, and beat Berube to give Ottawa the lead again. Berube gave up a nice rebound off a point shot from Erik Karlsson, and Stone made no mistake with that opportunity.  In the final minute of the second period, Ryan Dzingel was called for tripping Calvin de Haan. He would finish the period in the box, with his team on the penalty kill. They managed to escape the second still up 3-2.  3rd Period  After killing off the Dzingel penalty, the Sens found themselves on the wrong end of a great scoring chance from John Tavares. Breaking through the Ottawa defence, Tavares let a wrist shot go, which appeared to hit the crossbar. However, the referee called it a good goal. It was reviewed, and determined to not have crossed the goal line. Close call for Ottawa.  A few minutes later, Derick Brassard scored his 6th goal of the season. Mark Stone sent a shot towards the net, after it missed, Brassard picked up the puck behind the net and easily back-handed it past Berube. Smith and Stone grabbed assists on the goal, further proving the effectiveness of their line so far.  When Curtis Lazar took a tripping penalty in the final five minutes of the game, it looked like the Islanders might have a chance to make a last-minute push to tie the game. However, things didnêt go as planned. New York pulled Berube with over three minutes remaining, and Zack Smith was able to bury the empty-net goal from Ottawaês blue line. Just like that, Ottawa was up 5-2 late in the game.  Tom Pyatt would take a hooking penalty shortly after Smithês goal. Despite a number of quality scoring chances from the Islanders on the power play, they were unable to dig themselves out of this fairly steep hole. Pyatt would even get Ottawaês second empty-net goal of the night as he left the penalty box, making the final score 6-2 for Ottawa.  Sens Hero: Smith / Brassard / Stone line  They were responsible for four of Ottawaês goals, and combined for a total of seven points tonight. Zack Smith now has three goals in the last two games, and Mark Stone has registered six points in the last three. Needless to say, this line has found some chemistry.  Honourable Mention: Mike Condon It wasnêt exactly an offensive frenzy from the Islanders, but Condon came into this game unexpectedly, and played pretty well. He stopped 22 of 24 shots, and kept Ottawa in the game during some wild scoring chances for New York.  ",Lighthouse Hockey,Isles drop fifth straight game,"Tonight, the Islanders hosted the Ottawa Senators, a team that, entering tonight, held home-ice advantage in the Atlantic Division despite a goal differential of -7. Divisional playoffs, folks. Not that it matters to us anyways! The Senators were without Mike Hoffman, in the midst of serving of a two-game suspension for cross-checking Logan Couture in the back of the head. He's good. They started Andrew Hammond, who hadn't played an NHL game since October. The Senators were also on a back-to-back, having played the New Jersey Devils the night before, though in Ottawa and not across the Hudson River. Coach Jack Capuano rolled out the same lineup that lost to the Sabres the other night in overtime, as Casey Cizikas will likely be out a little while with an upper-body injury.  This meant that Anthony Beauvillier would play his second straight game, the first time he's played in back-to-back contests since November 28 and 30 against the Flames and the Penguins (he would then be healthy-scratched for the next three games - development!) Ryan Strome returned to the third line (if we haven't already, we should probably just start calling it the third line, at least for now) between Nikolay Kulemin and Cal Clutterbuck. Jean-Francois Berube, who didn't make an on-ice appearance until December 10 (for five minutes), started his second straight after making 34 of 37 saves against Buffalo. *Rob Lowe as Chris Traeger voice* This team makes LITERALLY... no sense at all. [Game Sum | Event Sum | Natural Stat Trick | HockeyViz] First Period: I thought they played last night? On their first shift, the Isles' top line of Anders Lee with John Tavares and Josh Baileycreated yet another scoring chance, as Lee, in his usual spot in front of the net, redirected a point shot across the crease to Bailey, who was just unable to get a stick on it. With Dennis Seidenberg pinching, Ryan Dzingel gained a step on Tavares and de Haan, Bobby Ryan trying to hit him with a stretch pass. The initial pass missed, but Dzingel, who took hoffman 's spot on the top line, retrieved it and quickly dished it to Kyle Turris barreling toward the net, forcing Berube to make a pretty save. Ottawa's top line found themselves on a 3-on-1 against Calvin de Haan (so Seidenberg was out of position again). Dzingel gave Turris a hard pass across the dots. Turris's shot caught Bobby Ryan in the arm and trickled past Berube, giving the Sens a 1-0 lead halfway through the period. Tavares danced around Jean-Gabriel Pageau but couldn't hold the puck. Josh Bailey grabbed it and fed Seidenberg at the point. With a large crowd in front of the net, Seidenberg ripped a shot that was redirected into the crease, forcing Hammond to dive, injuring himself. Mike Condon, who started the night before, replaced him. The Sens didn't let the injury shake them, however. On the next shift, Swedish wunderkind Erik Karlsson played Kulemin like a fiddle at the point before going across the blue line, and stone 's one-timer was tipped in front by Zack Smith. 2-0 Ottawa at 17:20, and that's how the period would end. Not a great start, and Ottawa led in the shots department, but the Isles had a lot of chances in tight. Second Period: A bit better Jason Chimera rushed down the wing and shot the puck at Condon, who made the save. On the ensuing face-off, Tavares lost but Bailey intercepted the pass and quickly flicked it at Lee, who fired the puck over the shoulder of Condon to put the Isles within one. Clutterbuck and Marc Methot jostled, and Methot put Clutterbuck in a headlock, but Cal was the one whistled down for interference. Phaneuf slid in and finished off a nice tic-tac-toe passing play from Stone, but Berube was there, as were three Islanders pushing Phaneuf into the iron. Sometimes they do things right. Also, Karlsson blasted one from the point that LITERALLY knocked Berube's stick out of his hand, after he just got his shaft on it. The Islanders would kill off the penalty, and Clutterbuck and Tavares engaged in a 2-on-1. Clutterbuck lost the puck, but it was grabbed and shot by Bailey. The rebound popped loose for Tavares, who had a yawning net, but couldn't corral the puck on the backhand in time. Travis Hamonic tried a drop pass that was picked off and fired at the skate blade of Berube by Stone. Later in the play, seemingly determined to right his wrong, Hamonic grabbed a weak shot from the point and hit Beauvillier with a stretch pass, giving him a breakaway that he would finish beautifully to tie the game at two. Credit to Berube for making a save in close off a turnover. The good feelings wouldn't last long, unfortunately. On the following shift, Thomas Hickeywould take a hooking penalty. Ottawa would score within the first 20 seconds of the man advantage, Karlsson again dancing around at the blue line to make a play. This time, he shot the puck at the crowd in front of the net, and Stone cleaned up the garbage to give the Senators the lead again, 3-2. The Isles abysmal PK struck again:  Just before the end of the period, Dzingel took a tripping penalty to give the Isles a power play. They were able to set up for a few passes before the second ended, but the penalty carried over to the third. Third Period: This Condon has no holes The carried-over power play produced a good chance that was started by a Strome zone entry and that was finished when Strome skated in to finish a centering pass, but couldn't slip it past Condon as the penalty expired. Five minutes into the period, Lee caught the Senators in a change and Tavares took his pass and sped in alone, ringing one off the crossbar. It would be originally called a goal, but Tavares didn't celebrate it, and after a quick review, it was called back. After Condon made a big save to keep his team in it, the Sens carried back the other way. stone 's shot went wide, but it was picked up behind the net and wrapped around past Berube by Brassard to give Ottawa a two-goal cushion. John Tavares is John Tavares, and among the things he does are try to take over a game himself if he feels it necessary. It's been very necessary this season. Unfortunately, it hasn't been a terribly successful effort. He battled against Methot and Cody Ceci behind the net, juggling the puck but ultimately unable to get a shot off. Curtis Lazar hauled down Seidenberg to give the Isles a last-chance desperation power play. They tried furiously in the first minute to get something going, and then after too many passes, Smith retrieved the puck and fired the puck at the empty net to seal the deal. Tom Pyatt would take a penalty to give the Isles another chance, though down three, it would've taken a lot. They went 6-on-4 but couldn't score, and Pyatt would put another one in the empty net. Don't try this at home, kids Somebody was That Guy tonight during the second period, sharing their most intimate moment on a Jumbotron in a smelly arena on a Sunday night. No, but really, good for them: What's Next The Isles are off tomorrow, and will be headed up to Boston to take on the Bruins at TD Garden at 7:00 p.m. The game will be on MSG+2, so prepare accordingly. Or don't. You probably wouldn't be missing much. Also, I wouldn't expect changes any time soon, unless the owners want to clear house:  I have a lot of belief in these guys. There's a lot of fight in that locker room and a lot of belief in one another.   This is Garth meeting with season ticket holders ahead of tonight's game, taking time out of his busy schedule acting in Bond movies in the 1960s. I'm glad they all  believe  in each other. That's all it takes to win. Not skill or anything.  "

Yup, it had been that long. Condon made 23 saves, Derick Brassard and Tom Pyatt scored 10 seconds apart during Ottawa's three-goal second period, and the Senators beat the Blackhawks 4-3 on Tuesday night for their third consecutive victory. Bobby Ryan added a goal and an assist as Ottawa held on for its first win at the United Center since March 28, 2001, stopping a seven-game road losing streak against Chicago. Dion Phaneuf scored a power-play goal, and Kyle Turris had two assists. ""The organization hadn't won here in 15 years,"" coach Guy Boucher said. ""So I think it's something good to celebrate, but we don't want to celebrate too long. Stay humble and keep working hard and battling. "" Artemi Panarin, Tyler Motte and Richard Panik scored for the Blackhawks, who had won five in a row and six of seven. Scott Darling made 26 saves while dropping to 6-3-1 in 10 starts since Corey Crawford had an emergency appendectomy on Dec. 3. ""They worked hard,"" said captain Jonathan Toews, who had a good look in the closing seconds but was unable to get his stick on the puck. ""They kept us in our zone more than we wanted to. I think we were too focused on getting on our rush. I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. "" Chicago played without center Artem Anisimov for the second straight game due to an upper-body injury, and forward Marian Hossa left in the first period with an upper-body injury. Coach Joel Quenneville said Hossa is questionable for Friday's game against Colorado. Panik's ninth of the season on a delayed penalty made it 4-3 just 1:42 into the third, but the Blackhawks couldn't come up with the tying score despite putting heavy pressure on Condon in the final minutes of the goaltender's first career game in Chicago. Panik had a shot go off the left post, and the 26-year-old Condon stopped a penalty shot by Marcus Kruger with 4:52 left. ""I was just trying to play him honest and not go down to early. I was lucky, I got a piece of it and it trickled wide,"" Condon said. ""Very thankful for that save. "" Condon got the win in relief of Andrew Hammond in Sunday's 6-2 victory against the Islanders. Hammond departed in the first period at New Yorkwith an ankle injury, but Boucher said he doesn't think it's a long-term thing. ""He should be fine in the next (few) days,"" Boucher said. Panarin's one-timer - a laser from just outside the faceoff dot in the left circle - tied it at 1 at 11:17 of the first. It was Panarin's fifth goal and 12th point in his last six games. It was still tied in the second when Brassard drove a pass from Chris Wideman past Darling for his seventh of the season just one second after a hooking penalty on Toews ran out. Moments after the ensuing faceoff, Ottawa drove right back down the ice and Pyatt showed off some nifty stickwork on the right side of the net for his fourth goal of the season at 7:41. Motte got one back for Chicago when Vinnie Hinostroza's deflected shot went right to him, setting up his first goal since Nov. 1 against Calgary. The rookie forward punctuated the score with a big upper cut as he skated behind the Ottawa net. Clinging to a 3-2 lead, the Senators then made the most of their third power-play opportunity of the night. With Brent Seabrook in the box for tripping, Turris' big drive went off phaneuf 's left knee and past Darling on the glove side at 14:22. ""We had to battle pretty hard to come away with two points,"" Ottawa defenseman Erik Karlsson said. ""If that's not the best team in the league, definitely one of them, and we could feel that today. "" NOTES: Crawford participated in the morning skate and was activated from injured reserve after the loss, putting him on track to play Friday against Colorado. G Lars Johansson was reassigned to the minors. ... Senators F Mike Hoffman returned to the lineup after serving a two-game suspension for cross-checking San Jose F Logan Couture. ... Seabrook got his 300th career assist on Panarin's goal. ... The Senators recalled G Matt O'Connor from Binghamton of the AHL to back up Condon. UP NEXT Senators: Host Anaheim on Thursday night. Blackhawks: Host Colorado on Friday night.  ",Ross A,Sens hold on for 4-3 victory over Hawks,"It ended rather scrappy, but the Senators werenêt complaining. A 4-3 regulation win over the league-leading Chicago Blackhawks would be a cause for celebration. The win marked Ottawaês third in a row, and gave them a four-point cushion over the Bruins for second spot in the Atlantic. Bobby Ryan opened the scoring with his fourth goal in as many games. He was tenacious on the forecheck, first helping Ryan Dzingel keep the play alive, then forcing Niklas Hjalmarsson into a blind pass up the middle. Kyle Turrisê shot was blocked, but Ryan fired it again before Scott Darling could track it. Chicago would get it back though later in the period on the powerplay. Artemi Panarin was left wide open for a one-timer, and Mike Condon just couldnêt react in time. The period would end tied 1-1, but with Ottawa holding an impressive 15-9 advantage in shots on goal. The Sens would open things up in the second. First, just as Jonathan Toews penalty expired, Chris Wideman put the puck in Derick Brassardês wheelhouse for a one-timer that Darling had no chance on. Then just 10 seconds later, Zack Smith would make a pass across for Jean-Gabriel Pageau who kicked it off the post, but then Tom Pyatt shovelled the puck in off Darlingês pad as he lay helpless in the net. The Hawks would get one back on a sweet play by Vinnie Hinostroza, who dangled before setting up Tyler Motte for an easy tap in. Two minutes later though, the Sensê powerplay went back to work, with Kyle Turris firing an Erik Karlsson feed off Dion Phaneuf and into the net. A 4-2 lead looked nice, but there was no way it was going to be enough against this powerhouse team. As it turned out though, it was enough. Not even two minutes into the third, Richard Panik scored on a very long delayed penalty. Apparently Phaneuf kicking the puck to him didnêt count as control, because the refs didnêt blow it dead, and he made no mistake with Condon unable to cut off the angle. Panik would then have a glorious chance to tie it, but his shot hit the post, and in his frustration he sent the Sens to the powerplay. The refs would then decide to let nothing go, calling Cody Ceci and then Ryan Hartman for what I thought were pretty soft calls, especially in a one-goal game. On the latter play, Marcus Kruger would find himself in behind a flat-footed Phaneuf, forcing the defenceman into a hold. Kruger crashed into the net, while his shot hit Condonês stick (which was somehow flying into the corner), then the crossbar, then Mark Stoneês skate, then Kruger standing on the goal line, and finally Condon grabbed it. Kruger got a penalty shot, but Condon got just enough of it to keep it out. The Hawks would pull their goalie with two minutes left, and the Sens never got possession outside their own blue line, but the Hawks couldnêt score. More than once, Condon had to scramble to cover a loose puck with his glove. Toews got a glorious chance in the crease after a great feed by Panik, but Karlsson got his stick on Toewsê stick to prevent him from getting a real shot away until Condon could smother the puck. The Sens actually ended up outshooting the Hawks 30-26, but were outshot 11-4 in the third. Still, they hung on for the victory, and will be in a comfortable spot heading into the Christmas break whatever happens on Thursday. Sens Hero: Derick Brassard He dominated play when he was on the ice, scored a great goal, and was just generally dependable. Heês been pretty good over the last couple weeks (probably since Stone joined his line). Honourable Mention: Mike Condon That was a flurry of shots late in the third, and he just seemed to track the puck well. I donêt know if Iêve ever seen a goalie make so many desperation dives to cover up loose pucks with their glove and succeed. Honourable Mention: Bobby Ryan Another goal, and three shots means maybe heês healed, and maybe he has some confidence. This team desperately needs both from their most expensive player.  ",Second City Hockey,"Chicago falls to Ottawa, 4-3, after Marian Hossa leaves early","The Chicago Blackhawks snapped a five-game winning streak with a 4-3 loss to the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday night. Itês the teamês second loss in a span of eight games, and only its third regulation loss at the United Center this season. The win is the Senatorsê third straight in the last four days. Injuries plagued the Hawks as Marian Hossa left the game after only 2:53 of ice time. Hossaês last shift was taken with just over five minutes left in the first period, but he would not return to the game for undisclosed reasons. His absence on the ice was felt early as the Senators jumped out to an early 1-0 lead, outshooting the Hawks, 15-6, in the first period. Chicago tied the game with a wonderful power play goal from the trio of Patrick Kane, Brent Seabrook, and eventual goal scorer Artemi Panarin. The goal was Panarinês 15th of the season, and Kaneês 23rd assist of the year. The second period saw Ottawa put its foot on the gas, scoring a total of three goals in the period. The first two goals came 10 seconds apart as Derick Brassard and Tom Pyatt tallied goals for the Sens early in the second. Things looked bleak as the Sens continued to outshoot Chicago, but Tyler Motte found the back of the net with eight minutes left in the period. The goal would be reviewed after Ottawa challenged that Chicago was offside, but the review was ruled inconclusive and the goal stood. For Motte, it was his fourth of the season and only his first goal since Nov. 1. In the third period, Chicago would notch an early goal from Richard Panik to close the deficit to 4-3. The goal was Panikês ninth of the season, and another assist from Kane puts him in third among all NHL players. Turning Point Marcus Kruger would be awarded a penalty shot late in the third period after the Hawks were short handed on a Ryan Hartman high sticking call. Krugerês first-ever penalty shot attempt managed to sneak through the blocker of Ottawa goaltender Mike Condon, but wide of the net. The missed opportunity to tie the game up proved a difference-maker. CH 3 Stars 1. Bobby Ryan, OTT (1 goal, 1 assist) 2. Kyle Turris, OTT (0 goals, 2 assists) 3. Patrick Kane, CHI (0 goals, 2 assists) Play of the game Kyle Turrisê shot that was deflected off Dion Phaneufês leg would ultimately be the game-winning goal. The goal came with a little over five minutes left in the second period.  "

Mike Hoffman scored a power-play goal at 4:03 of overtime as the Senators beat the Anaheim Ducks 2-1 on Thursday night for their second four-game win streak of the season. hoffman 's one-timer on a pass from Dion Phaneuf beat John Gibson in the Anaheim goal after Andrew Cogliano took a high-sticking minor at 3:23 of the extra period. ""We wanted to finish on a high note and there's not much of a better way to go into the Christmas break than with four wins in a row. Everyone worked hard and it's going to be a nice couple of days,"" Hoffman said. Ryan Dzingel scored in regulation for the Senators (20-11-3), who got 24 saves from Mike Condon. Jakob Silfverberg had the goal for Anaheim (17-12-6) and Gibson made 16 saves, but didn't face a single shot in the second half of the third period and just the one in overtime that beat him. ""I think for the first 30 minutes we played great and then after that we kind of let them back in the game. We stopped playing the way that made us successful and they took over the game,"" Senators captain Erik Karlssonsaid. ""We stuck to it though and we battled all the way through 64 minutes. It's a well-deserved Christmas break for everybody in here and everybody is excited about it. "" With the score tied 1-1 early in the third, the Senators were put in a tough situation when Bobby Ryan took a four-minute minor for high sticking, giving the league's second-ranked power play and extended opportunity. Other than when things got hectic around the Ottawa net in the final 20 seconds of the power play, the Senators really didn't allow the Ducks to create any sustained pressure. ""We could have scored on the power play and that would have been the difference in the game. We had a full four-minute power play that we didn't really generate enough with and it didn't give us any momentum,"" Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said. ""We still stayed with our game plan and that's more of the type of hockey that it's going to take to have success on the road, and we know that. "" The Ducks wrapped up their six-game, 10-day road trip 2-3-1, which included a 6-1 loss in Montreal Tuesday. ""We ran out of gas and we didn't have any life. We had a 2-1 hockey game (in Montreal) going into the third and they exploded and got four in the third on us. I didn't want that to happen (again) so I feel real good about our performance. We didn't get the extra point but we'll move on. "" The teams produced just 11 shots on goal through a scoreless first period, with the only real scoring chance coming late when Jean Gabriel Pageau redirected a shot just wide of the Anaheim goal. Both teams got on the board in the second period, with the Senators scoring early to take a 1-0 lead before the Ducks scored very late to tie the game. Dzingel took a pass from Kyle Turris and beat Gibson with a shot just under the crossbar from the left hash mark at 1:02. The Ducks thought they tied it with just over minute to play, but the goal by Nick Ritchie was immediately waved off as Corey Perry had backed into Condon in the crease. Perry redeemed himself a minute later when his no-look, through-the-legs pass landed right on the stick of Silfverberg, who scored a power-play goal with 10 seconds to play in the period. Shots on goal through the first 40 minutes favoured Anaheim by a low 14-12 count. NOTES: Fredrik Claesson and Craig Anderson were the scratches for the Senators. Korbinian Holzer and Stefan Noesen were scratched for the Ducks. Ducks forward Andrew Cogliano played in his 739th consecutive game. He is fifth all-time in consecutive games played and hasn't missed a game during his NHL career dating back to Oct. 4, 2007. UP NEXT: Ducks: host the San Jose Sharks on Tuesday night. Senators: play at the New York Rangers on Tuesday night.  ",nkb,"Sens get by Ducks, 2-1 in O.T.","The Sens entered tonight's contest looking to avenge a 5-1 loss to these same Anaheim Ducks earlier this month. As you may have heard, after that game Guy Boucher gave a rather terse media appearance in which he admonished his players for a lack of effort. Coincidentally (or not, depending on how you feel about these things) the Sens hadn't lost since then, a stretch that included one of their best performances of the season in a 4-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.  It's become something of an axiom in hockey writing that if there are no goals, then the gameplay must have been boring. In this case, you'll have to trust me that I'm not being lazy in telling you that the scoreless first period was boring. There were a mere 11 shot attempts apiece, just 11 total shots on net, and only one power play opportunity. Mark Borowiecki fought Jared Boll after Boro threw a mildly questionable hit and Jean-Gabriel Pageau missed a wide open net off a feed from Mark Stone. That was about it.  The second period got off to a more invigorating start, however. Just 1:02 in to the frame, Ryan Dzingel scored his 8th of the season after some great work from Kyle Turris and Bobby Ryanon the forecheck freed up the puck. It's been said by me here, and by many others elsewhere, that Dzingel's play has been one of the most pleasant surprises of the season so far; it's also been critical to the Sens' success.  For long stretches of play, the second period looked like the first: there was a lot of dumping and chasing. The Ducks slowly gained the upper hand midway through the period and only a somewhat questionable goalie interference call kept Anaheim from tying it.  But Puck Don't Lie as they say (I think?) and less than a minute later Jakob Silfverberg tied the game on the power play, finishing off a beautiful behind-the-back pass from noted jerk Corey Perry. The second period concluded with the teams deadlocked at one apiece after the Sens failed to generate a single shot attempt in the last nine minutes of play.  The third period brought renewed energy from the Sens and some actual sustained pressure. Unfortunately, Bobby Ryan took a careless high-sticking double major and Ottawa was forced to fend off the formidable Anaheim man advantage for a full four minutes. Thanks to a deflected shot off the post and some admirable defensive play from Marc Methot, in particular, the Sens survived and the rest of the third period was played without much incident.  It's hard to call this game an exciting affair, the Sens generated a measly 17 shots on net after all, but I'm sure that if you asked Guy Boucher he'd tell you he was pleased with the team's defensive effort. The Sens reached 20 wins before Christmas this year, and that's nothing to sneeze at. Nkb's 3 Quick Thoughts: -It's been covered several times already, but the disconnect between Cody Ceci's play and his usage is staggering at times. Ceci played nearly 28 minutes tonight and not only were the Sens shelled while he was on the ice but he was personally responsible for several bad giveaways. This is especially puzzling considering that Chris Wideman has had another solid season and that Boucher has at times been willing to deploy him with Phaneuf. This seems like an easy fix. -If you missed Erik karlsson 's mad end-to-end dash in overtime, I suggest you go back and watch it because it was truly incredible. When Erik Karlsson has the chance to wind up behind the net and hit his full stride, I find myself slowly rising out of my seat expectantly. It's one of the most exciting plays in all of hockey. -Ryan Dzingel is such a great skater that it's easy to overlook how skilled he is. His goal tonight was an absolute laser beam. Dzingel could have turned out to be a one-trick pony like a Darren Helm, but I think it's clear that his skill with the puck will keep him in the NHL for some time to come. Sens Killer: Jakob Silfverberg In addition to the goal, Silfverberg was the Ducksê best player on this night (and probably the best player on either team, to be perfectly honest). His line with Andrew Cogliano and Ryan Kesler gave the Sens all they could handle. Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman This wasnêt a game in which any one Senator particularly distinguished themselves, so weêll give the nod to Hoffman here for his overtime winner.  In overtime, a terrific end-to-end rush from Erik Karlsson led to a high quality scoring chance but it was Andrew Cogliano taking down Mike Hoffman with 1:37 remaining that proved to be the critical moment. Hoffman buried a one-timer with just under sixty seconds left in the extra frame and sent the crowd home happy.  ",Anaheim Calling,Anaheim 1- Ottawa 2 (OT): Bobby Come Back,"First Period: The most exciting Anaheim player in the first ten minutes was none other than Jared Boll. Of course this had nothing to do with anything related to offensive zone player. However, Boll took seven minutes worth of penalties. After taking offsetting minors, both he and Ottawaês Borowiecki fought. The altercation may have lasted a generous seven seconds. The period was an offensive struggle for both teams to say the least. There were a total of five shots mid period and an explosive six additional in the second half. Anaheimês top line was responsible for the majority of the chances and had half of the teamês overall shots (even with two minutes less of ice time). Besides making some typical lazer passes, Getzlaf had the best chance of the period by going to the net and getting a tip on a Rakell shot. Itês great to see the Ducks making an effort to cut down on defensive mishaps, but it cannot come at the expense of sustained offense.  Second Period: The Ducks started the period in the worst possible way by giving up a goal. Ryan Kesler turned over a puck behind the Anaheim net causing Josh Manson to pinch down support. This left Dzingel open in the slot for an easy goal. The first tick on the score sheet came at 1:02 into the period.  It felt like an eternity for anything to develop after the Ottawa goal. After some minor line changes from Carlyle, the Ducks started to get the ball rolling. With Ritchie moved up to the top line the twins were able to get the cycle game going. It looked like the trio had finally broken through when Ritchie one timed a perfect Getzlaf pass, but the goal was immediately waved off. The referee claimed that Corey Perry interfered with Condonês ability to make the save. Apparently this is not a reviewable play.  Anaheim got their revenge with a vintage Corey Perry sequence. The winger drew a penalty, won a few puck battles, and fed a streaking Silfverberg for power play goal. The goal came with only ten seconds left in the period. It was great to see the team rewarded after a much-improved final five minutes of the frame. The shots were 15-12 in favor of the Ducks. Third Period: Five minutes into the period, our old friend Bobby Ryan took a double minor for high sticking Hampus Lindholm. The Ducks managed to get three tremendous scoring chances against Condon. First, Theodore put a shot from the point off the elbow of the bar. Shortly after Getzlaf and Rakell led a 2 on 1 chance but the Ottawa goalie was up to the task. Lastly as the extra man opportunity expired, Getzlaf took the puck straight from the dot to the front of the net and barely missed getting his own rebound. Yet even with all of these chances the score still remained tied.  Both teams made it pretty apparent they were playing for overtime. Overtime: I could lie and tell you the Ducks won a game in OT, but we all know thatês not true. The Ducks went short-handed with less than two minutes to go and gave up the game-winning goal. At least it wasnêt a 3 on 3 situation for once.  "
35,1 Regular,12/27/2016,7:00 PM,A,New York Rangers,3,4,L,,20,12,3,L 1,36,19,0,4,0,25,17,1,4,0,"18,006",2:40,Rangers rally to down Senators 4-3,"Nick Holden has clearly been a valuable addition to the New York Rangers' defense corps this season. Two goals, including the game-winner, against the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday night proved he could be an offensive hero as well. Holden scored the go-ahead goal less than 7 minutes into the third period, lifting the Rangers to a comeback 4-3 victory. Holden's second goal of the game and sixth of the season came at 6:31 as he wedged the puck past Senators goaltender Mike Condon just 4 seconds after a Rangers' power play had expired.  Getting the win the way we did means more to me than scoring two goals,  said Holden, who was acquired by the Rangers from Colorado in a draft-day trade last June.  My game is not scoring. I like to play well defensively. I was just happy with the way the team responded.  Derek Stepan had two goals and defenseman Ryan McDonagh had a career-high three assists as the Rangers (24-12-1) overcame a 3-1 deficit and snapped a two-game losing streak.  The fans were behind us and we battled back,  said Stepan, who verbally urged his teammates to play better early in the game.  We had to lead by example and step up. There's so much emotion in this game. You have to take advantage of it.  Antti Raanta, who allowed goals on the first two shots he faced from the Senators, recovered to make 33 saves for the win, improving to 9-4-0 this season. Raanta started in place of Henrik Lundqvist, who didn't dress because of the flu.  Antti responded well and gave us a chance,  Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said.  The way we crawled back says a lot about the resolve of this group.  Raanta made several strong saves with the Senators on the power play late in the third to seal the victory, his best a denial of Mike Hoffman from point blank range. He also stopped former Ranger Derick Brassard in the waning seconds. The Senators (20-12-3) saw their four-game winning streak end even though they had a 2-0 lead just over 3 minutes into the game. Defenseman Mark Borowiecki scored his first goal of the season at 2:02 on a shot from the left point that eluded Raanta, who allowed seven goals in his last start at Pittsburgh. Ottawa forward Zack Smith followed with his eighth of the season at 3:08 with assists to Erik Karlsson and Mark Stone. Karlsson leads the Senators with 32 points, including 25 assists. Smith has four goals in his last five games. Holden, who leads Rangers defensemen with six goals and has 18 points overall, scored at 11:37 to narrow the deficit to 2-1 when he beat Condon from the right circle with a high snap shot. McDonagh and Kevin Hayesassisted. Defenseman Cody Ceci made it 3-1 for the visitors at 16:56 with his first goal of the season on a shot from the right point that found its way through traffic into the net.  We missed too many goals, that's clear,  Senators coach Guy Boucher said.  Even in the third period we got four posts and if any one of those four posts goes in, that's a different game. We played a good game here. It's too bad it didn't go our way.  The Senators, who beat the Rangers 2-0 at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 27, outshot the Rangers 12-7 in the first period and had a 14-10 advantage in the second. Just 2 seconds after a penalty to Ottawa's Ryan Dzingel expired, Stepan again made it a one-goal game at 2:45 with assists to McDonagh and Chris Kreider. Stepan tied the game with a power-play goal at 14:55 of the second, tipping a shot by Mats Zuccarello past Condon for his ninth goal of the season. McDonagh added his third assist of the game. He leads the Rangers with 21 assists. NOTES: The Rangers recalled rookie G Brandon Halverson, a second-round draft pick in 2014, from AHL Hartford to back up Raanta. ... Rangers D Kevin Klein played his 600th game. ... The Rangers continued to be without Fs Pavel Buchnevich (back), Mika Zibanejad (broken fibula) and Rick Nash, who missed a third straight game with groin injury. ... The Rangers make their lone visit to Ottawa on April 8. UP NEXT: Senators host Detroit on Thursday. Rangers visit Arizona on Thursday.  ",Ary M,"Sens blow two-goal lead, lose 4-3 to Rangers","The Sens first game since the holiday break can be told simply with two tweets. Sens played well, goalie didn't. It happens. Won't lose too often when you outshoot opposition 36-25 over long haul. Shot locations from senators at rangers are sort of bleakly funny. The game started off with a ton of joy, as three minutes in, Mark Borowiecki ended up with the puck at the left point and wired home a wrister for his first goal in almost a calendar year, on his first shot since December 15th.   One minute later, Zack Smith continued his hot streak after coralling a Karlsson shot and popping the puck past Raanta. With the Rangers coming off back-to-back outings where they had given up 7 goals, both Sens fans at home and the Rangers fans at MSG were thinking a similar outcome was in the works. The pace eventually settled down as all four lines got into the game, with the Rangers collapsing in front of Raanta and a neutral zone battle emerging between the two clubs. After Kyle Turris and Mark Staal took coinciding minors halfway in, the game opened back up and this time, it was the Rangers who cashed in. Nick Holden, ex-Avs defender whoês slotted nicely on the Rangers bottom-pair, was a thorn in the Senators side tonight and got the best of Mike Condon with a 4-on-4 goal from a bad angle. Itês the first of three that Condon would like to have back, and likely not the worst of the bunch. After Condon made two nice stops on Brandon Pirri and Mats Zuccarello, the Sens responded to the Rangers sudden outburst with another goal of their own. In an eerily similar fashion to Borowieckiês tally, Cody Ceci ended his season-long drought with a goal after Hoffman directed traffic by steering the puck in the high slot. Tom Pyatt, who was excellent in the first, flew by Raanta at just the right time to block his line of sight, allowing Ceci the deception needed to find twine. As always in a game of back-and-forth, the momentum swung again to start the second period. With Ryan Dzingel in the box after taking a hooking penalty 43 seconds in, Mike Condon fronted a Kreider shot but slid too far to the right, leaving the net wide open. Derek Stepan was first to the puck, and potted home his first goal of the period just as the penalty to Dzingel expired. The stage was then set for Antti Raanta to start his revenge on the Sens. With the Rangers called for too many men on the ice, Cody Ceci snuck in from the left point and came this close from getting his second of the night before Raanta sprawled out to make the save. The chance, set up after Bobby Ryan fronted a Karlsson shot and sent the puck to Ceci, gave Raanta very little time to push across, but the Rangers netminder was able to get his right pad on it to keep it as a one-goal game.  Then, at even-strength, Ryan Dzingel attempted to make amends for his earlier error and generated two great individual scoring chances. First, he flew down the right side past Nick Holden and one-handed the puck onto Raanta, and THEN had the wherewithal to stay with the puck to try and pot the rebound far side, but his attempt hit the post. On his next shift, Dzingel generates speed down the left side and has a 2-on-1, but Raantaês blocker had the answer.  As you can tell, the game opened up considerably, with Kreider using his speed to generate a chance on Condon and Stepan getting robbed by Condonês glove on an odd-man rush of his own. The physical play also picked up, with Chris Neil in the middle of it as always   ultimately drawing a penalty on Mats Zuccarello after the Norweigan retaliated on Neilês clean check of Brady Skjei near the Rangers bench.  The Sens donêt generate much on the PP outside of a Dion Phaneuf net-front chance, but due to some ensuing scrums, I think the refs got a bit worried on whether they could control the game. Hence, Jean-Gabriel Pageau was given a goaltender interference penalty after taking the puck aggressively to the net, and the Rangers cashed in quickly. It was the only goal against that Condon had no chance on, as a won face-off went back to McDonagh, across to Zuccarello, and then redirected by Stepan in the high slot past Condon to tie the game at 3. The third period was frustrating on many accounts. The physicality continued, with Mark Stone (!) fighting Jimmy Vesey after the latter blindsided Brassard (who was okay on the play) five minutes into the period. Kyle Turris then joined Stone in the box as he held Oscar Lindberg as he lost inside position defending the Swede off the rush. On the ensuing powerplay, the Sens did a great job pressuring the offence for a majority of the kill, but got sloppy with two missed clears near the end. It ultimately led to Nick Holden scoring from the goal line with a jam play short-side on Condon as the PP expires, giving the Rangers their first lead of the night. The Sens actually challenged for offside earlier in the play, and although it was unsuccessful, it allowed Guy Boucher to give his players a rest longer than a regular 30-second timeout wouldêve allowed. The _timeoutÓ appeared to work, as it was all Sens after that. Curtis Lazar (!) almost made it a first-goal hat-trick with a sneaky wrister off a won draw, and Marc Methot almost potted the teamês third goal by a defenceman on the night, but were stopped by the post and Raantaês blocker respectively. On consecutive Rangers offensive zone tripping penalties, the Sens hit twothree more posts, with ex-Ranger Derick Brassardês wrister hitting both but staying out and Hoffman hitting one of his own on the powerplay. Boucher rode the Hoffman - Turris - Stone, Methot - Karlsson unit for a majority of the period, with Karlsson playing over 11 minutes in the third. Kyle Turris hit another pipe in the final minutes of the game, but the Sens were unable to score, losing their first game in regulation after being tied after two periods this season.  All situations xGF (3.75 - 2.56) and scoring chances (33-26), by the way, ended up favouring the Sens. Like the two tweets at the beginning stated   sometimes, you generate a lot but end up unlucky. If the Sens, minus Condon, play like this every night, theyêre going to win a lot of hockey games.  Sens Heroes: Hoffman - Brassard - Stone The trio were on for 12 shots for and only 2 against at 5-on-5, and were responsible for many dangerous offensive chances tonight. Hoffman had two points in the first and found himself reunited with his old linemates, partly due to his improved play but also due to Zack Smith leaving the game early in the second with an upper body injury. He didnêt return.  Sens Zero: Mike Condon It was easily Condonês worst game of the season, with three goals (two to Holden) that heêd like back. He had a .924 sv% coming into tonightês game, but looked shaky against Anaheim before the holidays and unsure of himself tonight. He struggled in Montreal last season after taking on an increased workload, and Iêm starting to wonder if his 12 straight appearances are starting to lead to some fatigue seeping into his play. Matt OêConnor is up with the Sens tonight, but surely wonêt start Daniel Alfredsson day on Thursday. I wonder if Craig Anderson, whoês been around for most of the _bigÓ starts this season, is in net as TSN reported he watched the game from the stands tonight while his wife received treatment in nearby New Jersey.        ",Blue Shirt Banter,"Raanta, Holden, Stepan Lead Rangers Past Senators","After going down early in this game, the New York Rangers fought back from a two goal deficit and defeated the Ottawa Senators by a final score of 4-3. Antti Raanta, Nick Holden and Derek Stepan all had huge games this evening, with Stepan and Holden combining for two goals apiece. As for Raanta, he was simply spectacular after getting the surprising start, with Henrik Lundqvist getting the night off due to an illness.  Coming out of the Holiday break and on home ice, the Rangers were poised to have a quick start to this game. However, the Senators had other plans and quickly spoiled that start with an early goal coming at the 2:02 mark of the first period. Mark Borowiecki was credited with the goal after his point shot found itês way through traffic and beat Raanta just under the crossbar.  This game took an ugly turn about a minute later, with Zack Smith tallying his eighth of the season to give the Senators an early 2-0 lead. Following a stunning sequence of events, the Rangers were able to get a goal back at the 11:37 mark after Nick Holdenês sneaky shot beat Mike Condon over the shoulder.  Just as the Rangers looked to be turning the corner offensively, the Senators came right back and silenced the crowd once more. This time around, it was Cody Ceci who tallied his first of the season on a blistering shot from just inside the right circle. Just prior to the goal, Kevin Klein wound up blocking the vision of Raanta as the shot came on net, and prevented his goalie from seeing the shot.  Unfortunately, this has become an alarming trend lately for the Rangers, and they are allowing a ton of goals as a result of self-inflicted wounds. With the Rangers needing some sort of spark during the second period, Derek Stepan lead by example and brought the Rangers right back into the game. Stepan wound up scoring a pair of goals within a span of 12 minutes, including one on the power play, and evened up the game at the 14:55 mark of the middle frame. That set the tone for the third period, where Nick Holden would also net his second goal of the night, which gave the Rangers their first and only lead of the night. Holdenês game winning goal came from just below the goal line where he slipped the puck under Condonês pad, and jammed it over the goal line. Holden also made his presence known late in the game after swiping the puck out of the crease to prevent a goal by the Senators. Holden was often criticized by many early on this season, with myself included, but since then, he has quietly put together a solid season on the scoresheet.  With the goaltender pulled, the Senators attempted one final push in the offensive zone, but came up empty handed. While this game was anything but pretty, the Rangers found a way to overcome a two goal deficit and did so while fighting against the Senators trap game. Hopefully this will pave the way for a strong game on Thursday night against the Arizona Coyotes.  "

Anthony Mantha scored at 1:07 of overtime after Bobby ryan 's turnover to give the Red Wings a 3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Thursday night. The Senators retired Alfredsson's No. 11 before the game. The 20,011 fans, making it the first sellout of the season, kept the celebration going as they cheered for their former captain - and also a former Red Wing - at the 11:11 mark of every period. ""The crowd was into it and we had energy in the building to get us going,"" Senators captain Erik Karlsson said. ""We started pretty good and as the game went on again we started throwing pucks away and kept standing still and they played with possession for most part of the second half of the game. "" Thomas Vanek and Tomas Tatar scored for the Red Wings in regulation. ""We have to be like this every game whether it's home or away,"" Tatar said. ""We played really good, really responsible in every zone and we just played good hockey. "" Jared Coreau, who was born just outside Ottawa and grew up cheering for the Senators fan, made 26 saves. ""I thought it was (Coreau's) best game that he's played for us of the three,"" Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill said. ""I thought he looked the most calm, I thought he looked the most compact. He made big saves in the first when they were pushing. Obviously, he gave up the one at the end of the first, but he made big saves up until that point so I thought he did a real good job. "" Tatar teamed with Alfredsson with the Red Wings. ""I'm really, really happy for him,"" Tatar said. ""He's a great guy, great leader and a great player and he taught me a lot, too. He's a humble guy and he deserves it for sure. "" Derrick Brassard and Mark Stone scored for the Senators, and Mike Condonmade 26 saves. The Red Wings tied it at 2 midway through the second period when Henrik Zetterberg fed Tatar a stretch pass to send him alone to beat Condon. Notes: The Senators were without Zack Smith (abdominal strain), and D Fredrik Claesson was a healthy scratch. Detroit C Riley Sheahan and D Ryan Sproul were healthy scratches. UP NEXT Red Wings: At Toronto on Sunday. Senators: At Washington on Sunday night.  ",Ross A,Sens fall to Wings in OT on Alfie night,"It was Daniel Alfredssonês night. Win or lose, it was always going to be that way. The night put the spotlight on his family, with his parents, wife, brother, sister, and children all there. There were speeches by his brother Henric, and by his former teammate Wade Redden. A highlight video showed clips of big goals, hitting Darcy Tucker, and comments from many player in the organization. Everyone emphasized his work in trying to end the stigma around mental illness. They all celebrated his drive to work, and the fact that he always led by example. It was nothing flashy, but it didnêt need to be. He was never a flashy guy, and it honoured the biggest legend (so far) in franchise history. It was clear early on that the Red Wings werenêt going hang back just because it was Alfieês night. They opened the scoring on what looked like a soft goal at first glance but turned out to be well-worked. Brendan Smith fired a slapshot from the point flat on the ice, setting up an easy tip opportunity for Thomas Vanek. It looked like the Sens might exit the period down by a goal, but Mark Stone had other ideas. With just 17 seconds left in the period, his tenacious forecheck allowed Mike Hoffman to scoop up a loose puck and feed Derick Brassard for a surprise goal. Many were worried about the practice line of Pyatt-Brassard-Stone before the game started, but thankfully Guy Boucher was worried too, because he switched Hoffman for Pyatt to start the game.  The second period started out better for the Sens. This time the goal five minutes in came for the Sens. Brassard fed Stone from behind the net, and he made no mistake on a quick snap shot, and then celebrated like it was the biggest goal of his life (as Stone does). But halfway through the period, the Wings would tie it up. Henrik Zetterberg showed he still has his hockey IQ, spotting Tomas Tatar in position for a breakaway pass and putting it right on his stick. Tatar would go on to score on the breakaway. That also did it for scoring in the second, setting up an important third. The third period would start with the Sens on the penalty kill, a theme that continued for the first half of the period. However, the Wings continued their season-long futility on the powerplay, failing to generate much at all. They then seemed content to just play for OT, repeatedly gaining centre and putting the puck deep. And OT they got. Overtime wasnêt great for the Sens. They took possession off the opening faceoff, but didnêt really do anything before giving it up rather cheaply. Detroit would then take over from there. Just over a minute in, Bobby Ryan made a rather soft attempt to flip the puck out of the zone, but Niklas Kronwall held it in. Then he faked the shot, and hit a wide-open Anthony Manthawith a pass in front. Mike Condon had set up for the initial shot, so he was way out of place and Mantha had an easy goal to win the game. Honourable Mention: Mark Stone Stone was the the Sensê best player, credited with one point but really deserving too. Heês always causing turnovers, making smart passes, and pumping up everybody with his ridiculous celebrations. Dishonourable Mention: Bobby Ryan He gets an honourary assist on the game-winner, which mostly means he made a mistake at the worst possible time.  ",Winging It in Motown,Wings Take Down Senators 3-2 in OT,"The game tonight had a delayed start because of the retirement of Daniel Alfredssonês jersey. I thought it strange the Wings would retire a jersey at an opponentês rink but I suppose he played some games in Ottawa too. The Wings came into tonightês matchup 4-5-1 in their last 10 and just one point up on the Devils for the basement of the East. They are 6 points behind Boston for a playoff spot with a lot of teams to jump in between. If there is a time to begin a push, tonight would be a good place to start. The Wings have some bodies making their way back into the lineup of late with the return of Brendan Smith last game, and some others getting closer. Coreau got the start after a lack luster display by Mrazek in his outing against Buffalo. Iêm anxious to see what Coreauês massive frame can do, hopefully heês learned from the game tape and as noted in the broadcast to challenge to the top of his crease more. One thing that caught my attention in the pregame was the brief appearance by Maltby when he stated Athanasiou would be counted on for the rest of the season. Not that his word should be treated as gospel but hearing that from someone within the organization canêt be a bad thing. Hopefully they donêt mean on the wing with Ott and Miller. First Period Glad to see the line of Z, Mantha, and Tats has stayed in tact, that line has at least been fun to watch. And the teleprompter kindly points out that I was slightly wrong on my lead in......Athanasiou will be center between Ott and Miller. But that does mean with the late Sheahan scratch Jurco is being given a chance with Larkin, curious to see what they can do together. Ericsson with a good first shift looking mean against Karlsson and doing his best to drive the net in the offensive end. Kronwall steps into Lazar at centre ice and feel like weêre beginning to see a bit of a renaissance with him doing that again. Ericsson slides one just wide from a tight angle through the crease with the goaltender down and out, but even if it did go it may have been called back for interference. The Zetterberg line with a good follow up shift and the Wings have had the early pressure. The Nyquist-Vanek-Nielsen line with a good follow up shift with some sustained pressure. Smith with the shot pass from the point that Vanek deflects perfectly through the wickets of Condon. Yes folks, the Wings scored the first goal! 1-0 Wings! Letês hope thereês more of this to come. As Osgood notes the Wings have definitely been showing a shot first mentality which is a necessity when youêre as hard up as this team is for goals. The play starting to go a little back and forth now as the Sens are starting to wake up after their slow start. Glendening gets absolutely lit up at the red line by Borowiecki (sorry if I butchered that spelling). That was a huge hit. However it results in a Wings powerplay. Nothing going on the powerplay, no noteworthy chances. Ottawa with a good shift after the kill and Coreau makes a nice save on a one timer from the slot on a pass from behind the net. His first big test of the game and he comes up big. Ottawa keeps the pressure going and Coreau with another big time pad save on Ryan crossing through the slot. Turnover by the Wings defence into the slot, didnêt catch who it was and Coreau comes up with the save yet again. Mantha tries to turn the tide with a nice drive to the net that Condon just gets his glove on after it deflects off the defensemanês skate. Glendening takes a big hit from Neil and heês been taking a beating early. Turris with a good chance in the closing minutes after being left open in the slot but takes way too long to pull the trigger and itês blocked. DeKeyser canêt maintain control late in the period in his zone and the puck gets turned over. Karlsson with a quick pass to Brassard who beats Coreau short side to tie it 1-1 with 16 seconds to play. The Wings started the period strong but Ottawa came on strong in the latter half, game tied as it probably should be. Second Period Not a whole lot going on early with the teams trading failed rushes. Nyquist to Nielsen to Vanek with a good chance and a second whack to boot but Condon with the saves. Dzingel with an uneventful rush but demonstrating outstanding speed. On the follow up shift Brassard throws it from behind the net to a driving Stone who makes no mistake and hammers it far side. No chance for Coreau, 2-1 Sens. Ouellet with a couple good point shots on a good sustained pressure shift by the Wings, his second shot rings the post. Ottawa with a good chance on a shot that deflects off Smith that appears it wouldêve likely found the back of the net if not for Smith. Out of nowhere Zetterberg springs Tatar for the break with a gorgeous stretch pass and Tatar makes no mistake burying it blocker side low, tied up 2-2. Larkin with an attempted rush through the middle and you can definitely tell teams have keyed on that play by him this season, working together to slow him through the neutral zone and forcing him outside. Heês going to have to further develop his repertoire to maintain his success from last season. Wings manage to get a powerplay with 7:00 to go in the period in a game that has let a lot go. The powerplay with some good possession and puck movement but passes were all at the perimeter except for a puck that pinballed to Nielsen in the slot who slid it just wide. As expected shortly following the conclusion of the powerplay the Sens draw one and will go to work on their first powerplay. On the kill Ott does what he does best and takes another penalty, seriously how many times has he put this team down two men? The Wings kill off the 1:06 two man advantage doing a really good job of closing off the shooting lanes. The Wings kill off the remainder without much opportunity for the Sens. Mantha with a fast break and absorbs a good hack from Methot crashing hard into Condon, the Wings go back to the powerplay late in the period. No meaningful chances and theyêll head to the third with a 50 seconds left in the powerplay. Third Period The Wings donêt manage to generate much of anything with what remained of the Methot penalty. But no matter, Phaneuf to the rescue dropping Tatar for two minutes of his own. Not match happening (again) on the advantage, Jurco getting some time on the 5 on 4 and manages to get a half break but no shot off. Shortly after Tatar gives one back to the Sens with a high stick on Methot behind the net. Mantha with a crafty move at the end of the 4 on 4, recognizing the Ottawa penalty was expiring skated it back to his own zone to kill off a few seconds. The remainder of the Wings penalty is killed off without incident. Tatar draws yet another call, heês on his A game tonight. Letês see if they can generate anything this time. The Wings do manage to get a few good shots off this time with shots coming from the point with traffic in front. But once again none find the back of the net, back to even strength. The middle section of the period ticks away with nothing noteworthy to report. Iêve seen Mantha take advantage of his long reach in the defensive a few times this game which is good to see. As the game approaches the final 5 minutes the pace is decidedly slower with both teams looking like they want to make sure they get at least a point. Havenêt seen AA I think all period, really wish theyêd give him an opportunity here. Time runs out in the third with not a single thing happening to even make your heart pace change. Overtime Nielsen, Nyquist, and DeKeyser to start overtime. Time for some action after a dull third. Zetterberg, Kronwall, and Mantha late come on. Good cycle game by the Wings. Zetterberg forces Ryan in the corner to turn it over to Kronwall at the blue line. Kronwall drives the net, slides it across to Mantha who buries it past a sprawling Condon. Wings win 3-2! Oh lord have mercy that feels good to say. This and That Coreauês grandmother with an appearance on the broadcast and God bless her little heart, she seems like a delight. With a nice line for all of us during this time _Stay happyÓ. Maltby going by _MaltsÓ in the broadcast and theyêre pushing the nickname hard. I donêt like it. Jurco didnêt do anything awful this game, but didnêt appear to make any plays either. Heês going to have to be noticeable to stay in the lineup. Karlsson didnêt make much of an impact in this game, save for the setup of one of the goals which considering his talent, I would say they played him successfully. Ericsson had what I thought was a quietly good game. If you didnêt see it, do yourself a favor and get a look at the Zetterberg stretch pass to Tatar and Tatarês finish, Iêll remember that one for awhile. Those are big points against the second in the division Sens, please let there be more of this to come. A generally strong game from the Wings who didnêt give up much to the Sens, just need to get the PP rolling.  "
37,1 Regular,1/1/2017,7:30 PM,A,Washington Capitals,1,2,L,,20,13,4,L 3,24,4,0,4,0,28,8,0,2,0,"18,506",2:29,"Defenseman Taylor Chorney scores, Capitals beat Senators 2-1","Instead of high-powered forwards Alex Ovechkin and Marcus Johansson, two defensemen who rarely score came with big goals in the Washington Capitals' 2-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Sunday night. Taylor Chorney broke a tie early in the third period with his first goal of the season, beating goalie Mike Condon through a screen. Chorney has three goals in 130 NHL games in parts of seven seasons. As Chorney was taking the ice for the third period, he turned to fellow defenseman Karl Alzner, who tied the game with 20 seconds left in the second period, and jokingly said he would get a vital goal. ""I wasn't expecting to go out there and score, but I did. When we walked out, I said, `It would be nice to get the first of the year on a game-winner.' It worked out,"" Chorney said. Two of his three NHL goals have been winners. His first came on Feb. 15, 2011, when he was playing for Edmonton. ""Up here, you just try and go out and be reliable and if you get a chance to just score a few goals, you take them,"" Chorney said. Chorney has played well in his rare appearances with the Capitals. Since his Nov. 11 recall from Hershey of the AHL, he's appeared in seven games, and Washington is 6-0-1, and his coach was appreciative. ""Guys were cheering. We're all happy for him,"" Washington coach Barry Trotz said. ""There are certain things guys doing really well. Scoring for Taylor is probably not one of them, and when he does get one it's special for everyone. "" Alzner has been impressed with Chorney. The 29-year-old scored one goal with the Capitals in 55 games last season. ""He's unique. It's a super hard position to be in, the one that he's in right now. He doesn't get to play a whole lot. Every game he's played, he's been not just good. He's been great,"" Alzner said. Braden Holtby stopped 23 shots for Washington Kyle Turris scored for Ottawa at 12:41 of the second period to give the Senators a 1-0 lead. Heading into a five-day break, the Senators have lost three straight for the first time this season. ""I can't go sit on a beach somewhere and be content with this, so I'm going to go back to Ottawa and get on the ice and work,"" Condon said. The most unsettling time for Washington came midway through the third period when center Evgeny Kuznetsov and defenseman Brooks Orpik were called for penalties. But, the Capitals survived the two-man deficit. Washington has not surrendered a power-play goal in the past seven games - 28 power plays in all. Ottawa coach Guy Boucher doesn't like heading into a long break with three straight losses. It's the defenseman scoring that irked him. ""Those two goals are goals that we gave away. When it's one, you might get away with it, when it's two, it comes back to haunt you,"" Boucher said. NOTES: Washington sent F Jakub Vrana to Hershey of the AHL. . Ottawa C Craig Kelly played in his 500th game for the Senators while C Derrick Brassard played in his 600th NHL game. ... Senators C Zack Smith was out for the second straight game with an abdominal injury. UP NEXT: Senators: After five days off, host the Capitals on Saturday in the first of four consecutive home games. Capitals: Host Toronto on Tuesday night in the second of three straight home games. The Maple Leafs beat the Detroit Red Wings 5-4 on Sunday in the outdoor Centennial Classic.  ",Ross A,Sens fall short against Caps,"The Sens just couldnêt do it, ultimately falling to a red-hot goalie and his just-good-enough team. Taking place on the same day as the Maple Leafs/Red Wings Centennial Classic outdoor game, very few NHL fans even knew this game was going on. However, most Senators fans knew it was a chance to build up a slightly bigger lead for second in the division with many pretty good teams close behind. The loss instead put Ottawa on a three-game losing streak, making their fans just a little more nervous. Unfortunately, I was on the road when this game started, so I had to catch up using Gamecentre Live. All this to say, forgive me if I missed something huge. The first period was a pretty even affair from what I saw, with the Sens actually looking better but the Capitals holding them to the same number of shots on goal. The best opportunity of the period came with Kyle Turris ringing it off the post. Turris would make up for it in the second. After winning a faceoff in the zone, Marc Methot held it in at the point. Matt Niskanen missed it in the corner, allowing Ryan Dzingel to make an easy pass to a wide-open Turris in the crease who easily put it home. But with just 20 seconds left in the period, the Caps would get it back. Justin Williams would get a breakaway as a Caps penalty expired, but Mike Condon stopped it. However, the puck would stay loose, and would get sent back to Karl Alzner who ripped home his first of the year. The third period was where it was at, at least action-wise. It didnêt start great for the Sens. Taylor Chorney fired home his first in 10 months through a Curtis Lazar + Casey Baileyscreen. But from there, the Sens got several glorious chances. First, Mike Hoffman hit the post after blowing around Niskanen to create a semi-breakaway. Then Hoffman had another chance, but Braden Holtby skated almost to the blueline to beat him to the puck and take away the opportunity. Bobby Ryan would then give Ottawa a great opportunity by knocking Brooks Oprik to his feet, which led to Orpik taking a retaliation penalty against Ryan 20 seconds later. On the delayed call, Evgeny Kuznetsov decided to slash Turris, giving Ottawa two full minutes of 5-on-3. Unfortunately, the 5-on-3 yielded very little. The Sens had a lot of trouble getting set up, and Hoffman got the only real chances, missing the net once and shanking his shot the other time. Ottawa would keep pressing, but simply pressing isnêt enough against a goalie as good as Holtby. Ottawa was even outshot in the third period despite needing the goal. When you canêt score on two minutes of 5-on-3, you probably donêt deserve to win the game. And Ottawa didnêt. Final score: Caps 2, Sens 1. Honourable Mentions: Mark Stone, Mike Hoffman, Ryan Dzingel These three used their speed and smarts to create a number of great opportunities. You knew that if Ottawa managed to get a tying goal, it would be thanks to at least one of these guys. Sens Zero: Powerplay They went 0/4 on the night, including the length 5-on-3 I keep ragging on. But more importantly, it didnêt look good. Maybe the Caps played a more aggressive three-man PK than the Sens were used to, but they couldnêt connect on a pass. The team seems to have gone back to a _funnel everything through Karlsson and hope it worksÓ system, and tonight it didnêt. Sens Killer: Braden Holtby The only goal he let in he had no chance on. Other than that, he was very alert at breaking up plays, and very adept at stopping chances.  ",Japers' Rink,Caps Capture Capital Cities Clash,"The Capitals and Senators met for the first time this season in a New Years Day battle of capital cities in Washington, DC. The Capitals were able to squeak by their guests thanks to two goals from their rearguards in a 2 to 1 victory over Ottawa on home ice. First up, Sunday nightês Plus/Minus. Plus: Karl Alzner tallied his third goal of the season in the second period and all three of his goals this season have come against Canadian clubs (Winnipeg, Vancouver, and Ottawa). Minus: With 11 minutes to play Washington was whistled for two minor penalties during the same sequence of play, giving Ottawa a full two minute two man advantage. Nine more notes on the game: On the first shift of the game Derick Brassard was felled by a friendly high stick delivered by Mike Hoffman and Brassard stayed down before being escorted to the dressing room. He would return to the game a short time later and skated 19 minutes. Goaltenders Braden Holtby and Mike Condon kept the game scoreless through the first period with both staring down eight shots apiece through the first frame. But Kyle Turris got the scoring started a bit more than halfway through the game by tapping home a Ryan Dzingel pass past Holtbyês left leg pad atop the crease. Turris began the scoring play by besting Jay Beagle in the faceoff circle and the puck was in the net less than ten seconds later. With under twenty seconds to play in the second period Washington took advantage of a heads up breakout pass from John Carlson to Justin Williams to tie the game. After receiving a nice pass from T.J. Oshie it was Alzner hammering home a slap shot that beat Condon high. Guy Boucher and the Ottawa Senators challenged Alznerês goal, arguing that Williams entered Washingtonês offensive zone a stride offside. After a brief review, however, it was determined that Williamsê entry was valid and Alzner officially knotted the score. Early in the third period Taylor Chorney stepped into a slap shot from the blue line and found its way around a partially screened Condon. Brooks Orpik put the puck on a tee and Chorney made no mistake from a full sixty feet. Chorneyês goal was his first of the season. Tonight was his seventh time in the lineup this season. With Orpik and Evgeny Kuznetsov in the penalty box the Capitalsê penalty killing units successfully stymied Ottawaês offense with plenty of blocked shots and solid goaltending. Washingtonês defensive effort was given a standing ovation from the Verizon Center faithful. Jakub Vrana was sent back to the Hershey Bears this afternoon, one month after joining the Capitals on December 1st. Vrana tallied three points (1G 2A) in twelve contests.  "

""One mental lapse on the goal and a team like that is going to capitalize, but I thought we played pretty good for the most part with lots of shots and lots of chances,"" Condon said. ""Holtby is one of the best goalies in the league but all-in-all it was a pretty good effort. "" The Senators have lost four straight to drop to 20-14-4. They played for the first time falling 2-1 to the Capitals on Jan. 1. ""It's always a concern when you're not on the ice and you have a long break like that, but I thought we were pretty sharp considering,"" Senators forward Zack Smith said. On the goal, the Capitals broke into the Senators' zone and Oshie released a one-timer off a pass from Nicklas Backstrom past Condon. ""We scored on that controlled breakout, and after that there wasn't much happening between the blue lines on both sides,"" Capitals coach Barry Trotz said. ""We jammed it up and they jammed it up,"" Backstrom earned his 500th NHL assist on the goal. ""I'll remember this,"" Backstrom said. ""I knew it right away because I had been reminded a couple of times. I thought we did a good job shutting them down, killing off power plays and Holtby was great back there making saves. "" Ottawa had a late power play in the third period after Karl Alzner was called for boarding Mark Stone. The Senators had some solid chances during the advantage, but were unable to beat Holtby. They pulled Condon with 1:20 to play, but could only manage one shot on goal. Early in the second period, Oshie took a hard hit from Senators defenseman Dion Phaneuf at the Ottawa blue line. Oshie slowly made his way to the Washington bench favoring his left shoulder. After a few moments on the bench, Oshie went to the locker room. He returned later in the period, but sat out the third. Notes: Bobby Ryan was scratched for the Senators. Taylor Chorney and Liam O'Brien were scratches for the Capitals. ... Senators forward Curtis Lazar has yet to register a point in 18 games this season. UP NEXT Capitals: At Montreal on Monday. Senators: Host Edmonton on Sunday.  ",Trevor Shackles,Frustrating Night Ends With Ottawa Extending Losing Streak to Four,"After a much-needed week off in their schedule, the Ottawa Senators returned home to play the Washington Capitals once again in a game that was essentially a must-win after three straight losses. However, everyone knew it was not going to be easy against one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference. Although the first few shifts looked pretty good for Ottawa, it was Washington who struck first. TJ Oshieês lightning quick shot easily beat Mike Condon on a 3-on-2 rush; taking the excitement out of the building. The rest of the period was uneventful, with the Senators not being able to score on the only power play in the 1st. The Capitals had some good chances, although surprisingly the Senators had more attempts at 21-13.  The 2nd period saw Ottawa doing everything they could to respond. Early on, Erik Karlssonnailed a shot off the cross-bar that somehow stayed out, and the play was constantly in Washingtonês zone.  On their second power play of the night, they had the best puck movement in the offensive zone that I have seen in a while. Despite their best efforts through 40 minutes, they could not tie it up thanks in large part to the terrific play of Braden Holtby, and some bad luck from Ottawaês perspective. After two periods, the attempts were 45-31 for Ottawa, and it was beginning to feel like one of those nights where nothing they try works. It was not for a lack of effort; itês just that sometimes things donêt always go your way, as the game against the New York Rangers a few weeks ago showed. With 20 minutes to go, Ottawa was faced with some real adversity. It seemed inevitable that at some point the Senators would tie it up. The only thing is, when Braden Holtby is on his game, heês one of the best in the league.  The 3rd period was not Ottawaês best of the night, but they still deserved to get a goal somehow. When Karl Alzner got a cross-checking penalty on Mark Stone with under nine minutes to play, it looked like the Senators had their golden opportunity. Instead, they never really got a great chance, and the Capitals killed off their final penalty of the night.  In the dying minutes of the game, Ottawa threw everything they had at Holtby. Once again though, none of their chances were canêt miss plays, so Washington deserves some credit for keeping the shots to the outside.  At the same time, it felt like one of their shots would eventually go in. Karlsson, Stone, Hoffman, Dzingel, and others all had chances, but luck was not on their side. The Capitals could not put the game away with an empty-netter, so the game was there for the taking until the bitter end, but the Senators ended up catching no breaks. The final score, Washington 1, Ottawa 0.  It was another frustrating night that puts Ottawa on a four-game losing streak at a time during the season where every game begins to have serious playoff implications.  If youêre looking for a silver lining though, the Senators were the better team tonight. In all four of their losses, they have had more attempts on net than their opponent, so it seems like their play is trending upwards, even if the results are not always there. I think itês safe to say that tomorrowês game vs. Edmonton is another must-win, as this losing streak cannot get any bigger. Sens Hero Canêt really give this to anyone when nobody scored. However... Honourable Mention: Sens Best Players I can give out plenty of honourable mentions, though. I canêt single out one player, but Ottawaês top guys were dominant tonight, even though the goals did not come. Mark Stone (+29 in corsi), Derick Brassard (+20), Mike Hoffman (+19) and Erik Karlsson (+19) were in the Capitals zone almost the entire night, and thatês encouraging to see.  The depth players were not quite as successful as usual, but at least there were 11 players above 50% in possession, and seven above 60%. Sometimes you have to acknowledge the small victories. Sens Killer: Braden Holtby Thereês only one answer for this, and itês Braden Holtby. He didnêt have many spectacular saves, but you have to give him credit for not making a single mistake through 60 minutes. 30 saves on 30 shots is impressive, and he was the reason why the Capitals walked out of the game with two points. Sens Zero: Puck Luck Come on, seriously? Just give us one break, thatês all we needed.  ",Japers' Rink,Backstromês 500th Assist Delivers Washington Win,"The Capitals and Senators met for the second weekend in a row and this time with Nicklas Backstrom on the verge of a milestone assist. Backstrom tallied assist 500 early in the first period on what would be the game winning goal in a 1 to 0 shutout victory. First up, Saturday nightês Plus/Minus. Plus: The Capitals got on the board early, taking advantage of an Ottawa team that has not played since last Saturday in Washington. Minus: T.J. Oshie left the game late in the second period and did not return for the final frame. Nine more notes on the game: 98 seconds into the contest Oshie scored by firing the puck over Mike Condonês left shoulder from the left circle with a snappy one timer. His early goal was Washingtonês 26th time getting on the scoreboard before their opponents this season. Nicklas Backstrom recorded his 500th assist on Oshieês early goal which makes Backstrom the 10th Swede to tally 500 assists in the NHL. Congrats Nick! Early in the second period Oshie was stood up by Dion Phaneuf in the neutral zone which caused Oshie visible discomfort. He continued to play in the second but would eventually leave the contest after only 9 minutes of work. Late in the second period Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Ryan Dzingel found themselves in alone on a 2 on 1 but Braden Holtby stood tall against Dzingel before making a strong save to keep Ottawa off the scoreboard. The Senators outshot Washington through the first forty minutes 21 to 13 but excellent penalty killing and goaltending allowed the Capitals to start the third period with the one goal lead. The excellent penalty killing extended into the third after Karl Alzner was whistled for boarding Mark Stone. A Tom Wilson shot block against Erik Karlsson , that had to hurt, was the highlight of the late kill. Holtby captured the shutout victory, his second in a row, by turning aside all 30 Senators shots. Washingtonês eight second period shots were the most they could muster in any period tonight. Bobby Ryan was a healthy scratch for the Senators.  "

Mark Stone had a goal and two assists, Mike Condon stopped 35 shots and the Senators beat the Edmonton Oilers 5-3 Sunday night. Ottawa scored six times in a win over the New York Islanders on Dec. 18, but had totaled just 12 total goals in six games since before finding its offense against Edmonton. ""The guys putting five up on the board and playing great defensively, that's how you break those type of streaks, with a gutsy type win,"" Condon said. Zack Smith, Mike Hoffman and Kyle Turris each added a goal and an assist while Tom Pyatt also scored for the Senators. Patrick Maroon had two goals and Leon Draisaitl also scored for the Oilers. Connor McDavid had two assists and Jonas Gustavsson made 13 saves. Edmonton entered the third period trailing 4-3 and desperately pressed for the tying goal but Condon shut the door. The Oilers outshot the Senators 17-3 in the period and 29-8 over the final 40 minutes. ""We got into a bit of a tailspin there but it was a fun third and a lot of action,"" Condon said. ""The puck was bouncing everywhere in the third period as we were getting chances. I thought we should have won,"" said Maroon, who has five goals in his past three games. ""I thought in the first period we weren't that sharp but I felt the second and third gave us a chance where we could have gone 3-1 on a really hard road trip. "" Turris scored into an empty net to seal the win. Trailing 2-0 after one period, the Oilers tied it on Maroon's two goals 63 seconds apart. He beat Condon through the legs from in close at 5:58, and then banked in a shot off Senators defenseman Cody Ceci at 7:01. McDavid started the play that led to the second goal by stealing the puck at the Ottawa blue line, but his shot on the ensuing breakaway was wide. Maroon picked up the puck along the boards, shot and scored. ""I'm playing with really good line mates, Leon (Draisaitl) and Connor (McDavid) and without those guys some of those goals don't go in,"" Maroon said. Draisaitl gave the Oilers their first lead of the game when his shot from behind the net hit Condon and went in with 7:01 left in the period. Despite having just five shots in the second, the Senators managed to close out the crazy period with two goals to regain the lead. Stone scored with about 6 1/2 minutes to go to tie it, and Pyatt put the Senators up 4-3 with 1:46 remaining. ""Four's too many and you don't win in this league giving up four, yet I don't think we played that poorly,"" Oilers coach Todd McLellan said. ""Kind of mixed emotions and I'll have to review the game a bit, but I don't think we gave up a lot but we gave up enough to lose the game. "" The Senators opened the scoring just 3:36 into the game when Smith beat Gustavsson through the legs from the top of the crease after a bit of a scramble around the Oilers' net. Seconds later the Oilers nearly tied it on a backhand shot from Benoit Pouliot that beat Condon, but not the crossbar. Later in the period, while on the power play, Erik Karlsson took a point shot and broke teammate Dion phaneuf 's stick. Hoffman then hit the post with a one-timer from the face-off circle before scoring on the exact same play moments later with 5:06 left in the peirod for a 2-0 Senators lead. ""I really liked our first period. It was about paying the price in front of their net and getting the shooting mentality,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""I thought we were very aggressive and brought a lot of energy into that period but when we came back in the second period, whoops, we didn't have that shooting mentality. "" NOTES: Fredrik Claesson was scratched for the Senators. Brandon Davidsonand Jesse Puljujarvi were scratches for the Oilers. ... Senators forward Curtis Lazar has no points in 18 games this season. ... The Senators had scored just three goals in their previous 11 periods before Sunday. ... McDavid leads the league with 15 multi-point games and has more assists (34) than the top point-getter on 14 other teams in the league. UP NEXT Oilers: Host San Jose on Tuesday night. Senators: Host Pittsburgh on Thursday night.  ",Ross A,Sens survive Oilers in 5-3 win,"It wasnêt particularly pretty, but the Senators did just enough to beat the Edmonton Oilers, halting their losing streak at four. Many were skeptical of playing Mike Condon in both night of a back-to-back, but he was rock solid in leading the Sens to victory, despite a 38-18 (!!) shot advantage for the Oil. The first period actually went pretty well for Ottawa, as they held a slim 10-9 shot advantage, and had a more important 2-0 goal advantage. The first came off an attempted Mark Stonepass to Derick Brassard that was instead blocked straight to Zack Smith in front, who snapped it home. The second came on the powerplay for a change, with Mike Hoffman one-timing the puck off Kris Russelês stick and over Jonas Gustavsson. Notably, that was Hoffmanês 11th goal of the season, tying with with Stone for second on the team (until Stone scored later in the game). In the second period, Patrick Maroon and Leon Draisaitl would hit 16 and 15 goals on the season respectively, meaning two relatively unheralded Oilers would both be leading the Sens in goals this season. After the first, the Oilers would outshoot the Sens 29-8, so itês not surprising that the second period started out poorly for Ottawa. The Oilers would take a 3-2 lead, thanks to two goals by Patrick Maroon (the latter giving Connor McDavid his lone point of the night), and one by Leon Draisaitl. But then a funny thing happened - the Sens scored two after those ones. First, Smith returned the favour to Stone, hitting with a cross-ice pass that he buried. Then Tom Pyatt continued his weird season by shanking a Cody Ceci pass flat on the ice and somehow into the net through a scrum. Ottawa had the lead with under two minutes left in the second, and it didnêt really make sense. But no complaints. And the Sens would hold that lead through the third period. Somehow the Sens held on despite being outshot 17-3, and one of those Sens shots was an empty-net goal. I donêt remember any ridiculous saves for Condon, but he was always in position when a shot got through, and collected when he didnêt catch the puck exactly how he wanted to. With about a minute and a half left, the Oilers gained centre, dumped it in, and pulled the goalie. Ottawa recovered the puck, worked it out to centre, and Kyle Turris put it in the net. It sealed a victory the Sens probably didnêt deserve, but it felt good after a pair of losses to the Capitals in which the Sens definitely deserved better. Sens Hero: Mark Stone I think he gets a hero nod every time I recap. Probably because he is the straw that stirs the Sensê offensive drink. Honourable Mention: Cody Ceci Credit where credit is due - Ceci had two assists and led the the team in 5v5 Corsi. He also had the highest time on ice by nearly four minutes, which says a lot on a team with Erik Karlsson. For my money, he looked like he actually deserved the ice time tonight. Honourable Mention: Mike Condon A .921 save percentage isnêt ridiculous, but it was very good in a game in which his team needed him to be very good. Deserves a lot of the credit for this game. Oilers Zero: Jonas Gustavsson A .765 save percentage, including a couple whiffs on not great shots. Remember when they used to call him The Monster?  ",The Copper and Blue,Oilers 3 - Senators 5  Truly a Monstrous Performance,"Whether the emotion elicited was the desire to repeatedly kick a brick wall, punch watermelons, or simply cry yourself to sleep, there will be a variety of coping methods for frustrated fans tonight as the visiting Edmonton Oilers fell to the Ottawa Senators 5-3, playing the second of back-to-back games this weekend. Well-deserved losses are met with disappointment, but the frustration and utter lack of contingency that is felt when the loss seems undeserved is even more maddening.  The Edmonton Oilers outshot the Ottawa Senators 38-18. They soundly beat the home team in shot attempts 72-37. Only two players finished below 50% in CF. But when your backup goalie saves only 13 of 17 shots faced and puts up a 0.722 save percentage on the night, victories are hard to come by, no matter how well the rest of the team plays. If a netminder underperforms, it perhaps carries an unfairly heavy influence on the overall result, but in the end, the goaltender is still a part of the team.   We win as a team, we lose as a team. That's how it is,  said Coach McLellan when asked about Gustavsson's performance.   Four is too many; you don't win in this league giving up four,  he added.  I didn't think we played that poor[ly], so mixed emotions, gotta review the game a little bit. Again, I didn't think we gave up a lot, but we gave up enough to lose the game, and some of the opportunites that we had— I thought their goaltender played extremely well, and we've got to find a way to put those in. But if we're trusting and relying on our offense to give us five or six a night, that's going to be a tough task.  There will likely be a few Jonas Gustavsson-themed voodoo dolls created in Edmonton tonight, as he was the difference-maker tonight in the worst way possible. The steady play of Cam Talbot has rendered unnecessary any substantial commentary on goaltending, aside from pointing out that he, as expected, put up a great performance in net. Tonight's game made us realize what an absolute luxury it is to have a netminder that doesn't give you extreme anxiety each time the puck comes within a few feet of the net. By the end of this game, I had a raging headache as bad memories from my days as a Leafs fan growing up flooded my consciousness.  Gustavsson arrived in North America from Sweden in 2009 as the top goaltender from the Swedish Hockey League, and it was the Toronto Maple Leafs who were  lucky  enough to win his services. The nickname  The Monster  quickly took on a more literal meaning, and it was with a mild degree of horror that I received the news of his signing with Edmonton this offseason. While Gustavsson seems like a great teammate and it would make everyone happy to see him do well, tonight's game unfortunately highlighted the reality that if Cam Talbot were to ever be injured, the Oilers would find themselves in an incredibly dark place.  It was the Senators who initially dominated in the opening period of this game, as the Oilers had trouble making any clean zone exits with a big glob of fumbled passes. A bad giveaway by Nuge in front led to a plethora of shots from the Senators, and eventually they opened the scoring at 3:36 into the first when a wrist shot by Zack Smith beat Gustavsson for his ninth of the year. The sloppy play continued, and Mike hoffman 's snap shot on the power play quickly made it 2-0 14:53 into the first, capitalizing on the Oilers' inability to clear the puck, even with Dion Phaneuf missing their stick and having to leave the ice. All in all, arriving in town at 2am and playing an overtime game the night before showed, with little of the intensity and polish of the Devils game present just 24 hours later.  The Oilers woke up just before the second period, and began the period by outshooting the Senators 5-0 in the first five minutes. It was the Oilers' leading goal scorer Patrick Maroon who finally broke through at 5:58 into the second to cut the lead to 2-1, showing great patience with Letestu driving to the net and unexpectedly taking the shot himself to take sole possession of the team lead in goals. Anton Lander and Adam Larsson, Swedish humans with the same initials, picked up the assists on that goal.  Patrick Maroon wasn't even done. Just a minute and thirty seconds later, after missing with his shot on a clear breakaway, McDavid corralled the puck and got it over to Maroon, whose shot hit Ceci and trickled past Condon to tie the game at 2-2. With that goal, Patrick Maroon now had sixteen goals on the season, and Connor McDavid picked up his league-leading 33rd assist.  Not content with being overtaken so suddenly in the goals category, Leon Draisaitl's casual backhand pass from behind the net took a lucky bounce off of Mike Condon at 12:59 into the second to put the Oilers up 3-2 with his 15th of the season. Just 34 seconds later, however, Mark Stone responded to tie the game at 3-3, streaking down the wing and fighting off a backchecking Zack Kassian to get a slapshot past Gustavsson. Ceci would help the Senators reclaim the lead with 1:46 left in the second as Taylor Pyatt's tip-in also beat Gustavsson to make it a 4-3 game, courtesy of a nice play by Ceci and some sloppy coverage by Russell and Gryba. The Oilers were down a goal despite outshooting the Senators 21-15, and the difference may very well have been goaltending-- after two goals on five shots in the second, the sight of Cam Talbot's face was sorely missed.  The Oilers definitely came out with more jump in the third, outshooting the Senators 17-3 in the final period, with play unfolding almost solely in the Senators zone. A number of great saves by Condon on McDavid and Draisaitl denied the Oilers of the equalizer despite a flurry of pressure, and the stellar play of the Senators' goalie rubbed some coarse sea salt into the wound that was the Oilers' goaltending situation tonight. Gustavsson was pulled with 1:30 left when the Oilers did not have possession, and the Senators immediately capitalized with an empty-netter from Kyle Turris with 1:22 left to seal and steal the 5-3 victory for the home team.  The Good  My personal highlight of the game was definitely seeing the Oilers' hidden goon Matt Benning getting into his first career NHL fight with Chris Wideman, who upended and cross-checked Lander at center ice. No one was expecting to see #83, whose appearance is more reminiscent of a happy-to-lucky elementary school kid, as the one involved in a fight, but it brought a tear to me eye to see him not only stick up for his teammate, but destroy his opponent, as well. The top line is still buzzing, and it was apparent tonight, especially in the third period. They scored all three goals tonight, and all three players on that line finished with a CF% above 80%, combining for 14 shots on net. Patrick Maroon chipped in five hits on top of his two goals, Draisaitl made an insane between-the-legs pass in the third period, and McDavid'stwo assists tonight padded his lead atop the NHL scoring race with 46 points, two ahead of Sidney Crosby.  Oscar Klefbom continues to show good confidence offensively, finishing with six shots tonight after getting nine yesterday, at one point taking the puck end-to-end on his stick and registering a shot on net late in the third period.  The Bad Not a great effort by Ryan Nugent-Hopkins tonight, finishing -3 and one of only two forwards with a negative CF%. Looked rather invisible out there.  Boy, Iêm not sure Bob Cole was familiar at all with any of the Oilers players, referring to everybody as McDavid, interchanging all the defensemen to the point where everyone was Larsson. The Ugly Sigh Game in a Haiku  Porous as a sponge.  More holes than fishnet stockings.  Jonas Gustavsson.  "

Outscoring Pittsburgh's captain was a bonus. Hoffman scored the winner, and Mike Condon made 29 saves to help the Senators beat the Penguins 4-1 on Thursday night. ""The whole idea with Mike is he's got the speed to skate with anybody in this league,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said about Hoffman. ""Since the beginning of the year he's definitely progressed defensively. It doesn't take away from his offence as he scored again tonight and he's got I don't know how many shots, but he played terrific and when you see players like that growing and becoming really good two-way players you know your team is going in the right direction. "" Bobby Ryan, Tom Pyatt and Mark Stone also scored for Ottawa. Not only did the Senators avenge an ugly 8-5 loss to the Penguins last month, they handed the defending Stanley Cup champions their first back-to-back regulation-time losses since Dec. 14-19, 2015. Pittsburgh lost 5-2 to Washington on Wednesday night, Conor Sheary scored for the Penguins. Matt Murray, playing for the first time since suffering a lower-body injury Dec. 28, made 29 saves. The Penguins didn't make excuses for their play. ""I would have liked to see that streak continue, but sometimes you need to lose a couple in order to play better,"" Crosby said. ""We haven't deserved to win the last couple games and sometimes when you're playing well you get some bounces given and good teams find ways to win games that they're not their best, but we didn't deserve to win the last couple so we've got a find a way to get back on track here a bit. "" Holding a 3-1 lead to start the third, Ottawa held off the Penguins and midway through the period put the game out of reach when Stone scored his 13th of the season. ""We stuck with it the whole game and we've been struggling this year having the lead going into the second and I think we cleaned most of it up this game,"" said Senators captain Erik Karlsson, who picked up two assists while playing a season low 21:36. ""They're a good team and they got their quality scoring chances and we got some big stops when we needed it and I think we just stuck with it all the way to the end. "" Frustration was clearly setting in for the Penguins and coach Mike Sullivan was given a game misconduct and ejected with just under two minutes remaining. ""I think we need to recognize when we don't have our best,"" defenseman Ian Cole said. ""Maybe we need to play more of a territorial game, stop trying to beat guys one-on-one, which we can do when we're at our best, but when we don't have our legs and our jump maybe we need to play a little bit smarter. "" Condon was at his best in the second, making a number of big saves, including one on Phil Kessel and another on Nick Bonino. He also got a little help when Scott Wilson rang a shot off the post. Leading 2-0, Ottawa was able to extend its lead midway through the period when Pyatt re-directed karlsson 's shot over Murray's right leg. The only blemish for Condon was giving up a goal with 6.4 seconds remaining in the second when Sheary tipped Evgeni Malkin's shot to get the Penguins on the board. The Senators couldn't have asked for a better start. Ottawa opened the scoring with a power-play goal at 5:29 as Ryan scored his eighth of the season, beating Murray through the legs. Less than four minutes, Hoffman re-directed karlsson 's point shot to make it 2-0. Notes: The Senators remain without G Andrew Hammond (ankle) and Clarke MacArthur (concussion).

Senators: Host Toronto on Saturday night.  ",Colin4000,"Condon, Sens, defeat Penguins 4-1","On Throwback Thursday, the Ottawa Senators defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-1, in a game that featured stellar performances from many players. Pittsburgh entered the game tired off a 5-2 loss the previous night to the Washington Capitals, whereas the Sens were well rested, fresh off a three-day break. The game started off at a very high tempo, with both teams exchanging great chances in the first few minutes. Chris Kelly had a chance wide open in the slot, although it was turned away by still-rookie goalie Matt Murray. The first goal of the game came 5:29 into the first period, off a Bobby Ryan slapshot from the top of the left circle on a power play. This put a close to Ryanês five game pointless drought, and got him his first point since his mysterious healthy scratch last week. Just a couple minutes after the Ryan goal, Steve Oleksy took a hooking penalty against Kyle Turris, putting the Sens on the power play once again. Turris won the draw, and the puck went right to Karlsson on the point who fired it towards the slot. The shot-pass found Mike Hoffman, who cleanly deflected it into the top corner past Matt Murray. The goal came a mere 10 seconds into the Pittsburgh penalty, giving the Sens an early 2-0 lead with less that half a period gone by. The rest of the first was relatively uneventful, with the Sens being unable to convert on their third power play of the period, and Ryan Dzingel getting a close chance in the dying seconds. Earlier in the frame, the Sens took their league leading 10th bench penalty for too many men. This has clearly been a problem for the team this season, and has cost us 20 penalty minutes that could have been easily avoided.  One player who had a really good first period was Bobby Ryan. Besides his power play goal, he seemed very re-energized. Itês been a long time since Iêve seen him skate as fast as he did in that period, and he was doing a great job creating chances on the power play. This was definitely one of the Sensê best periods in a long time, at least for the first half. Ottawa led in shots heading into the second, 15-8. Period two saw a momentum shift for the Penguins. They were getting pucks toward Mike Condon, and were creating havoc in the Sensê defensive zone. Condon stayed solid, denying Phil Kessel on a breakaway as well as robbing Nick Bonino and Chris Kunitz by sticking out the right pad. It was one of a handful of highlight-reel saves for Condon on the night. Approaching the 13 minute mark of the period, the Sens jumped to a 3-0 lead off a tip by Tom Pyatt. Similar to the Hoffman goal, Karlsson took a shot from the point directly off a faceoff win from Jean-Gabriel Pageau, and it hits Pyattês stick right in front of Matt Murray. It trickled in, giving Pyatt his fourth goal in his last nine games, and his second straight. Somehow, he keeps finding ways to put the puck in the back of the net. He finished the night with a Corsi percentage of 56%. The period was spoiled at very end, as with 4.6 seconds remaining, Conor Sheary got his 11th goal of the year off a tip that just beat Condon blocker side. It was a bit of a weaker period for Ottawa, although they come out of it up 3-1. The final frame, like the second, was primarily a battle of the goaltenders. The Penguins took three more penalties, including a game misconduct to head coach Mike Sullivan after he was arguing with the referee over a goaltender interference call. This gave the Sens ample opportunity to get shots off, which they did for the most part. Pittsburgh also did what Pittsburgh does, and did a great job at sustaining pressure. Condon was fantastic, keeping the high-scoring Penguins to only a single goal. Stone reassured the Sensê lead after shovelling in a backhander off a slick feed from Derick Brassard. This is the playmaker we hoped for when we traded for him in the offseason, and he really shined tonight. He finished the night with two assists. The Sens won their second straight after losing their last four in a row. On the other end, this is Pittsburghês first time losing two straight in regulation since December of 2015. The final shot count was 33-30 in favour of Ottawa, while the shot attempts were near even at 57-56 for the Sens. Sens Hero: Mike Condon This was an easy pick, as he made many stellar saves that couldêve resulted in a least three more goals for Pittsburgh. Donêt look now, but his .922 save percentage is getting really close to Craig Andersonês .924. Honourable Mention: The Sensê power play Sure, when the opposing team takes five minor penalties youêre bound to get a bounce somewhere. However, the Senatorsê power play looked legitimately lethal tonight, especially in the first period. Itês getting closer and closer to the accelerated power play that Guy Boucher has been preaching. Honourable Mention: Jean-Gabriel Pageau Pageau seemed to rediscover his shorthanded offensive flair tonight, creating a couple great chances in the Penguinsê end. He finished with four shots on goal, and a 5v5 Corsi percentage of 60.87%. Honourable mention: Mike Hoffman and Erik Karlsson Honestly, I could probably give everybody an honourable mention for tonightês performance. The Hoff had one goal on four shots, and the captain had two assists to break his four-game point drought.  ",Pensburgh,"Pens come out flat, lose again","Pregame Matt Murray (out injured since December 28th) is back and in the net. Tom Kuhnhackl (out himself since December 16) also gets back in the lineup at the expense of Eric Fehr otherwise the team is the same as last night's game. 1st period Ottawa gets an early power play, and Bobby Ryan puts them on the board first with a one-time slapshot from the left side that eludes Murray. 1-0. A couple failed clears didn't help the cause. The Pens get a power play but concede 3 shots, luckily Murray keeps it out of the net. However, right after the Pens PP expires, they take another penalty and give up another goal on the PK when Mike Hoffman tips a shot in the high-slot, no chance for Murray there. 2-0. Shots 15-8 Ottawa after one. Arguably one of the Pens worst periods of the season between being outshot, taking 3 stick penalties (giving up 2 goals), general sloppy play. 2nd period Pretty quiet first half of the period, then Sidney Crosby loses a faceoff and then loses coverage of Tom Pyatt who makes a tip-in from point blank range past Murray to make it 3-0 Senators. Yikes. (Someone tell Nick Bonino it's a contract year) With just 6 seconds left the Pens finally get on the board, a nice shift from an improvised Conor Sheary - Evgeni Malkin - Bryan Rust line that culminates with Malkin throwing a shot on net that Sheary tips in. It's a night of redirects!  Pittsburgh lucky to get some life to go into the second intermission since they looked pretty much dead-in-the-water before hand. 3rd period The Pens switch up some lines to start the period, Wilson is up with Malkin-Hornqivst, HBK is put back together and Chris Kunitz is bumped to the 4th line with Matt Cullen in an attempt to unite some old man strength (probably). Of all the changes, the most visibly impactful is Wilson, who flashes with the puck and a couple of strong shifts with Big Gene. Pittsburgh pushes for a goal, which means openings the other way, a couple nice saves by Murray to keep the team in the game for a while, but that comes to an end on a weird change (and Kris Letang getting caught waaay up ice) and Derrick Brassard lays a nice pass up for Mark Stone to tap in to make it 4-1. With 1:57 left to go in the game, coach Mike Sullivan actually gets kicked out of the game. Pretty rare to see the NHL referees boot a coach off the bench. Some Thoughts A night after taking 2 minor penalties, Steve Oleksy cuts ruts to the penalty box again early in the 1st, which leads to the goal to make it 2-0. Maybe it was a LH/RH thing, but why play him over David Warsofsky (healthy scratch again)? That goal really put the team in a hole. A night after hitting the post in Washington, Scott Wilson rings a puck off the cross-bar in Ottawa. Tough luck for him right now, but hopefully he keeps shooting and eventually the pucks will start going in the net for him, one would think. Interestingly for Wilson, he got 3rd period shifts on the Malkin line (after Carl Hagelin hasn't done much lately except take penalties last night and tonight). As we've harped on before, LW goal production from guys not-named-Sheary has been a major issue all season. If only there was someone in the organization who played LW (even if listed as a center) and was scoring a lot at a lower level.... But, half kidding aside, Wilson isn't going to get an indefinite chance to play on a Malkin line, nice to see him string a couple of good shifts together, even if he wasn't able to score. No coincidence the 2 tipped goals both originated off the stick of Erik Karlsson before the teammate redirected.  The Pens PP was bad, bad, bad, coughing up pucks and often giving up 2-on-1's and chances against. Off top of mind, not sure they even generated a scoring chance of their own on the PP. In the 3rd down 4-1 the Pens put Crosby out for a SH faceoff (though Matt Cullen was shaken up from blocking a shot with his foot at the time too) and Sid creates a 2-on-1 and shot. Didn't score but certainly interesting to see 87 out there in any 4v5 situation. Justin Schultz had 5 shot attempts on the night. Sounds good right? Yeah, but each and every one of those 5 were blocked by a Senator. (Insert shrugface here) Of the last 9 goals the Penguins have allowed, Letang's been on ice for 7. Bound to happen with the volume of minutes and top competition he faces, plus he's still probably under the weather, but Pittsburgh's best defenseman is fairly out-of-sync following his December injury and the bye week. In fact, even though the Pens beat (a tired) Tampa 6-2 on the first night back from the bye week, the whole team hasn't really look in sorts. First time all season the Pens have lost 2 regulation games in a row, in fact first time in 90 regular season games.  An unsuccessful road-trip but the team has a chance to finish it on a better note Saturday night in Detroit.  "

McElhinney, who was claimed off waivers from Columbus earlier in the week, made 35 saves as the Toronto Maple Leafs topped the Ottawa Senators 4-2 on Saturday night. ""That was unbelievable,"" said Maple Leafs forward Nazem Kadri, who scored two goals. ""He played great and gave us an opportunity to win the game. That first star was definitely well-deserved and a solid debut. Tyler Bozak and Connor Brown also scored for the Maple Leafs, who moved into a tie with the Senators for third in the Atlantic Division at the halfway point of the season. ""For me, it was just going in there and building some trust with the guys,"" McElhinney said. ""It's one of those things where you're trying to figure out what they're going to play like defensively, offensively and that type of stuff. There's a little bit of sorting out, but for the most part, I felt comfortable right off the bat. "" McElhinney added that he likes the look of his new team. ""They're real fast,"" he said. ""It's unbelievable the speed they have and their willingness to make plays in tight areas is so incredible. It's a lot of fun to be around a youthful group. It feels good to come to a new team and the most important thing is just to get off on the right foot. "" Dion Phaneuf and Kyle Turris had goals for Ottawa, and Mike Condon made 23 saves. Kadri's second goal of the game gave the Leafs a 3-2 lead just 2:31 into the third period. The Senators got their first power play of the game when Frederik Gauthierwent off for tripping at 4:01. Ottawa looked to have the equalizer, but McElhinney made a sprawling save to deny Mike Hoffman on his one-timer. Minutes later, Erik Karlsson hit the post behind McElhinney and, within seconds of that, Brown gave the Leafs a 4-2 lead with a quick shot after Auston Matthews won a faceoff in Ottawa's zone. The teams were tied at 2 through 40 minutes after the Leafs had jumped out to a 2-0 lead. Kadri opened the scoring on the power play when he tucked a rebound underneath Condon at 6:26 of the opening period. Bozak gave the Leafs a 2-0 advantage just 1:07 into the second when he intercepted a clearing attempt from Bobby Ryan, moved in on the Ottawa goal and waited for Condon to make a move before beating the netminder. The Leafs were carrying the momentum through the period, but that changed when Phaneuf got the Senators on the board at 9:15 of the second. His point shot hit Leafs defenseman Jake Gardiner before eluding McElhinney. The Senators tied it at 18:50 when Turris beat McElhinney with a shot far side to the top corner. Ottawa coach Guy Boucher pointed out that the Senators led the game in several categories, including shots (37-27), body checks (38-30) and faceoff wins (68 percent). ""We hit a goalie that just stood on his head, and that's going to happen,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""They were opportunistic, we weren't, and in terms of stats, you can't do much more than that. "" NOTES: Fredrik Claesson was scratched for Ottawa. Josh Leivo and Garret Sparks were scratches for the Maple Leafs. ... Chris Wideman became the 100th player to play in 100 games for the Senators when he suited up against the Leafs. It was also the 100th game of his NHL career. ... Senators F Mark Stone remains one assist shy of 100 for his career. UP NEXT Senators: play their next three games on the road, starting with the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday. Maple Leafs: host the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday.  ",Beata Elliott,"Sens Play Solid Game, but Lose 4-2 to Leafs","Tonightês match-up between the Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Maple Leafs was touted as the most important Battle of Ontario game in 13 years, a revival of a rivalry that hadnêt produced much in the way of entertainment of late. Forty-one games into the season, a Hockey Night In Canada showdown against provincial rivals had legitimate playoff stakes; the two Ontario teams found themselves separated by only 2 points in the standings.  For the sake of the playoff spot they were barely hanging on to, the momentum swing created by the Pittsburgh win, and the brave souls who ventured all the way to Kanata only to have beer poured on them by rowdy Toronto Maple Leafs fans, the Sens needed this win.  As most Sens fans already know, thatês not exactly a recipe for success: the Senators have seldom brought their A game against their provincial rivals. Or their B game. Or even their C game, really. Itês been quite humiliating. The disappointing thing about this game wasnêt that the Sens rolled over and died like they tend to do against their provincial rivals, but rather that they played so well and yet fell so short. It was a good game, honestly. If Ottawa continues to play the way they have recently, they should be legitimate contenders for a playoff spot. But man, tonightês affair was frustrating. Ottawa got off to a respectable start, out shooting their opponents 15-10 in the first frame and generally looking like the better team despite occasional flashes of brilliance from the Leafsê youngsters. Their defensive play looked solid, and they kept possession in the offensive zone even if they didnêt manage to score. However, after a Zack Smith penalty Nazem Kadri tapped the puck past Mike Condon in a scramble around the Ottawa net. It wasnêt a pretty goal by any means, but Torontoês impressive record when scoring first had many Sens fans justifiably nervous. It seemed our worst fears would be realized when Tyler Bozak scored a beauty of a goal only 1:07 into the second period. The goal came off a bad turnover from Bobby Ryan, and lazy defensive coverage from the struggling Phaneuf - Ceci pairing. During the early parts of the second frame Ottawa looked particularly slow compared to the Leafs, and their continuous failure to generate any significant chances in the offensive zone had this game feeling all too familiar to Sens fans. The turning point came a little over 9 minutes into the period, in the form of a rocket from the point by Dion Phaneuf against his former team. Howês Jared Cowen looking, Leafs fans? The goal bounced off of Jake Gardiner, and was originally credited to Jean-Gabriel Pageau before being given to Phaneuf.  That seemed to put a little wind in the Senatorsê sails, as they generated a number of good chances in the second half of the period and eventually evened the score on a gorgeous short side wrister from the always consistent Kyle Turris.  Unfortunately, the third frame started off about as badly as the second. It didnêt take long for Kadri to reclaim the Leafsê lead with his second of the night, something of a flukey goal that Mike Condon probably should have had. Ottawa got a chance to tie it again with a power play that generated a number of exciting chances but ultimately failed to convert, due in large part to the brilliance of former Senators goaltender Curtis McElhinney. Mike Hoffman had the best scoring chance of the man advantage, but was robbed by the Leafsê netminder. Even strength brought more pain and disappointment when Leafs forward Connor Brownscored off a pass from some nobody from Toronto. I think his name is Auston something? I havenêt really heard much about him lately. I doubt heês any good. As it turns out, cute kids celebrating goals is actually pretty annoying when theyêre scoring against your team. Ottawa fought hard, but ultimately wasnêt able to get anything past McElhinney for the remainder of the game. It was a disappointing loss, one in which the Sens deserved much better, but at least theyêll get a chance to further embarrass redeem themselves a week from today in Toronto. Sens Hero: Kyle Turris This man is so consistently amazing. Iêd love to see what he can do with better wingers, but even with Dzingel and Ryan, heês been solid all season. His goal tonight wasnêt enough to win the game, but it certainly made things a lot more exciting.  Honourable Mention: Dion Phaneuf The other goal scorer also turned in a solid performance against his former team. Itês worth noting that he also got significant amount of ice time with Erik Karlsson, which probably contributed to his play. Sens Killer: Curtis McElhinney Is anyone surprised, really? Of course a former Sens goalie had the game of his life against us. This would have been a very different game if not for McElhinney, as the Sens were robbed multiple times on quality shots.  ",Pension Plan Puppet,Home away from home,"We all know the Leafs have a pretty rough schedule in terms of back-to-backs. In fact, I think theyêre close to leading the league in that category. And while it seems like a small issue, it can have a big impact on a season, especially if it swings a couple points in a close playoff race. Based on their recent play, it seems like the Leafs will be in that playoff race, at least for the foreseeable future, and the amount of back-to-backs they have might be one thing that works against them at the end of the year, especially given the state of flux with respect to the backup goaltender position. But I guess the league has to make up for giving Toronto extra home games when they go to Ottawa somehow. The Sens, home of the leagueês best defenseman and leagueês worst owner (non-Carolina division), are their usual selves this year. Not good enough to be a contender, not bad enough to have a significant chance at Nolan Patrick. Nonetheless, they enter tonight two points ahead of the Leafs, and this game represents a chance for Toronto to claim Ontario hockey supremacy as they head to the second half of the season. Last time they were here, Auston Matthews stole the show in his first NHL game. Hereês hoping he does it again, this time in a winning effort. Normally, I think Iêm pretty fair to the opposing team in recaps - that will not be the case tonight. The Sens can get fucked. First Period [20:00] Looks like Curtis McElhinney will make his Leafs debut tonight. Obviously, the Leafs are going to look to him to stabilize the backup spot, which has been relatively tumultuous in the first half of the season. [20:00] The Sens uniforms are so bad. [20:00] Mike Condon will start for the Sens. Heês been pretty good this season. [19:22] The Sens generate a couple innocent shots on their first shift. Looks like Boucher will try and match the Matthews line with Pageauês group.  [17:22] Did I hear right? Curtis Lazar is looking for his first point in his 21st game? I get that heês on the fourth line, but jeez.  [16:11] Matthewsê line generates a nice cycle shift (along with Gardiner and Carrick), forcing Condon to freeze the puck. [15:11] Pretty slow pace to the first five minutes. Not the Leafs typical run and gun game so far. [14:26] Zack Smith takes a penalty for running Zaitsev into McElhinney. The Leafs power play has been lethal recently - letês see if they can keep it going. [13:48] Very loud _Go Leafs Go!Ó chant! [13:34] The PP keeps on humming! Nazem Kadri pokes it home after Bozak shoots it on net from the circle. What a season heês having! Leafs lead 1-0. [13:00] Ottawa has a nice shift in response, getting a few chances. Again, theyêre using Pageauês line against Matthewsê. [11:10] SportsNet shows a nice graphic of where the Leafs most recent power play goals have come from - almost entirely right in front of the net, and from memory, a lot of them were rebounds. [10:14] A terrible giveaway from Hyman to Turris in his own zone leads to numerous chances for the Sens, including Dzingel being left alone in front. McElhinney saves the day and preserves the lead for Toronto. [10:14] Actually, watching it again, it was more Dzingel shooting right into McElhinneyês body. [9:09] The Leafs come in offside, but Soshnikov shoots anyways (kind of bush league). Obviously that attracts a scrum. [8:33] Honestly, Ottawa is generating the bulk of the chances now. McElhinney has done well to keep the lead. Robs stone in front. So far, the Kadri line has held their own, but some of the other ones of struggled. [7:20] As I say that, the Bozak line has an excellent shift with some solid territorial advantage. [5:01] This might be the worst period for a Matthews line in a while. Theyêve been largely ineffective, and hemmed in their own zone for shifts on end.  [3:35] Bozak with a nice pair of passes, first to JVR at the top of the circle, and the second to Marner in the slot. Neither made it on net, but both strong chances generated by him. [2:25] The Leafs definitely look like theyêre on the second night of a back to back here. Doesnêt bode well for later in the game, if theyêre feeling it in their legs now.  [0:43] The Leafs with another strong shift from Bozakês group - likely the best forward group for the Leafs this period.  [0:00] First period ends, with the Sens getting the better of it in terms of pressure, but the Leafs getting the goal.  Second Period [19:08] Bozak with another excellent centering pass up to Marner, who has it hop over his stick! [18:53] And the play continues, with Bozak making it 2-0 Leafs! Bobby Ryan turns it over in the slot (tipped by Marner), and Bozak walks in and chips it under Condonês arm. Great play from Bozak, who has been one of the Leafsê best skaters tonight.  [17:52] Kadriês line follows that up with some more pressure, though not many shots.  [17:01] Matt Martin with a stunningly good backhand pass (!!!!) to Soshnikov in the offensive zone, but his shot is blocked.  [16:09] Man, Matthews is so skilled. He just flipped the puck over the stick of a Sens forechecker to himself to exit the zone. The poise and confidence to try that is incredible.  [15:38] More pressure from the Leafs, as Rielly and Zaitsev patrol the blueline behind the Bozak group. Much better period for the Leafs so far.  [14:57] This Bozak group has been very impressive to my eyes, especially dominating versus Derrick Brassardês group for Ottawa. [14:57] The broadcast is talking a lot about how Marnerês speed creates a lot of chances for his linemates. Which it definitely does. But I think his agility and dexterity on his edges is even more impressive. His balance and core strength must be nuts. [13:24] McElhinney has had less to do this period, but heês been excellent all game. As youêd expect from a goalie who has let in no goals. [10:51] The game has settled down a little, which is appreciated by the Leafs, Iêm sure. [10:45] And the Sens score. The former Leafs captain does it, as a Phaneuf blast (that was definitely going wide, by the way) deflects off Gardiner into the net. No chance for McElhinney. 2-1 Leafs. [10:08] The Sens have a really aggressive goal horn. The sounds guy leans on it HARD. [9:03] Havenêt checked the TOI, but it seems like the Leafs have leaned heavily on Gardiner-Carrick tonight. Wouldnêt surprise me if they were the leading defence pair tonight. [6:27] After watching him for almost two periods, I can confidently say that Curtis Lazar is pretty bad at hockey. [5:21] A no-call that goes the Leafs way in the neutral zone leads to a Hunwick chance against Condon, but the defender canêt put it away.  [3:27] Iêve really liked the look of the Leafs fourth line tonight. Granted, I think theyêve played almost exclusively against the Sens fourth line, but theyêve forechecked aggressively, limited chances against, and been a little pesty as well.  [2:34] Ohhh, what a save by McElhinney! A great pass from Ryan to find Dzingel all alone in front is in vain, as the Leafs backup makes it across. Huge, huge save.  [1:50] An excellent shift from Kadriês line is turned around on the Leafs. After extended pressure from the Leafs, Turris takes a sharp angle shot on the rush that finds the very top corner. 2-2 game. That was just about the perfect shot.  [1:11] Real shame for the Leafs there, as that was off the back of a strong shift. Kadri forced a centring pass which led to the zone exit for Ottawa. [0:00] Period ends all knotted at 2ês. Big third period coming up, and if fatigue rears its ugly head, it could be an unfortunate one for Toronto. Third Period [19:31] A nifty move from Nylander in the neutral zone frees up Kadri to enter the zone, who spies Rielly entering as a trailer. A hard shot from Rielly is handled adeptly by Condon. [18:01] I wonder what the quantifiable impact of a back to back is in terms of shot attempts.  [17:29] Kadri scores again! Komarov wins a faceoff with the help of Kadri, and Nylander sets up in his office on the half-wall. He feeds Kadri in front, who gets the puck off before the two Sens defensemen can take it off him. And what a shot it is, going top corner. 3-2Leafs! [16:55] Along with the Bozak group, Kadriês line has been generating the bulk of Torontoês chances at even strength. Well-deserved goal for them. Nylander and Hunwick with the assists [16:01] Side note - Hunwick and Polak have spent over half their even strength ice-time with Kadriês line. Iêm not sure if itês an intentional matchup thing or not. [15:59] Gauthier takes a tripping penalty, and the Sens get a chance to equalize right away. [15:06] The Leafs PK is its usual aggressive self, but the Sens do get set up. [14:50] Another great save by McElhinney, as Stone sets up Mike Hoffman beautifully with a cross-crease pass.  [14:00] Komarov with a couple excellent plays on the PP to break up chances. [14:00] God, the Sens game ops are aggressively loud between whistles. No wonder no one wants to come to the games. [13:56] Anyways, the Leafs kill off the penalty. [13:47] Thereês an update in the broadcast about Clarke MacArthurês return from the latest in a series of concussions. I really, really hope heês able to make a full recovery. One of my favourite players in the league. [12:18] Chances back and forth now. After great puck protection from Komarov and Nylander, the Leafs get a few point shots with traffic in front. After the puck goes the other way, Erik Karlsson rings one off the inside of the bar. [12:08] You canêt keep the Matthews line quiet all game! Matthews races to a loose puck after intentionally losing the draw, and centres to Downtown Connor Brown, who makes no mistake in front. 4-2 Leafs. [12:01] Not the best game from that line in general, but they (and Matthews in particular) are such game breakers. [11:37] Big pair of goals for the Leafs. Gives them a little breathing room.  [11:13] The Sens are really pushing now, and the Leafs seem to turtle more than most teams with a third period lead. Could be in for a lot of pressure for the rest of this game. [9:51] Zach Hyman is basically a poor manês Wayne Simmonds without the finishing ability. [9:02] Does Karlsson ever take a rest? Feels like heês always on the ice. [8:56] Zaitsev gets goaded into a fight by Dzingel, and promptly takes him to the ground. Donêt fuck with quiet Russians. Weêll get some 4-on4 as a result. [7:58] Periodically, Guy Boucher has mixed up his defense pairs and put Karlsson and Phaneuf together. Together, they average out to a defenseman with average mobility. [6:48] Iêd expect to see a fair bit of Soshnikov taking some of Nylanderês defensive zone shifts as this game heads into crunch time.  [5:07] The Matthews line is coming alive here in the third, and they kill some valuable time in the Ottawa zone. [3:42] Babcock sticking with Nylander on Kadriês line, not electing to go Soshnikov yet. So it looks like my call was wrong, at least for now.  [2:53] The Leafs have shut this game down quite effectively since the 4-2 goal. Ottawa has had real trouble generating anything, and the Leafs are protecting their blue line brilliantly.  [1:50] Ah, NOW Soshnikov is taking Nylanderês spot. So i jumped the gun calling it. [1:04] Unsurprisingly, Ottawa piles on the pressure with the net empty. So far, the Leafs are keeping them to the outside though.  [0:00] More pressure but no goals, and the Leafs win! Big win for the Leafs, who are in the playoffs with half the season to go! Itês been a great 41 games for the team, and Iêm hoping more than 41 games await us this season.  "

""Especially after a shift after they scored we put on some good pressure and got a few chances. When you pressure any team obviously they're going to be loose pucks and I got it there and fired it in. "" Stone took a puck off the leg earlier in that same shift.

Stastny evened it with a power-play goal midway through the first. Stastny has seven points, including four goals, in his last seven games. Hoffman regained the lead for the Senators with a power-play goal with 6:34 left in the second period. Hoffman scored his third goal in his last four games after Kyle Turris' shot went off Robert Bortuzzo and deflected right to his stick. ""I'm just kind of sitting in that spot,"" Hoffman said. ""It wasn't much their goalie or their `D.' It was just a lucky bounce that landed on my stick. "" Ryan made it 3-1 Senators 85 seconds later. Hutton thought he had Ryan Dzingel's shot covered with his pad, but the whistle never blew and Ryan banged the rebound into the net. It was ryan 's 18th goal and 32nd point in 25 career games against the Blues.

Shaky goaltending and high offense from both ends is what made this a 6-4 game, in favour of the Ottawa Senators. Mike Condon made his 10th straight start, and Carter Hutton made his third straight as Jake Allen has been struggling in the past month. The first period started off with a fisticuff, as Chris Neil and Ryan Reaves would drop the gloves only two minutes into the game. Neil had to take some big punches from Reaves, who was gritty the whole night throwing the body. Less than a minutes after the fight, the Sens scored the gameês opening goal for their 18th time of the season, after Jean-Gabriel Pageau potted the rebound off a Pyatt shot. The play was made possible by Erik Karlsson, who made a nifty steal to keep the puck inside the Bluesê zone. The Sens have now won 77.78% of games theyêve scored first in, tops in the NHL.  Later in the period, Kyle Turris took a hooking penalty, sending St. Louis to the power play. The Sens would almost fend off the Blues, except Paul Stastny would tip a Jay Bouwmeester shot just past a screened Condon, only seconds after the penalty expired. The Sens would get a power play chance later in the period, and although they had some good chances, the first period ended 1-1. The Sens led 8-7 in shots.  The first half of the second period belonged to the St. Louis, as the Sens would go minutes at a time without getting a shot attempt. The Blues would cycle the puck over and over, recovering after every chance. The Sens were fortunate to get out of that stretch unscathed. Ottawa regained the lead 13:26 into the second, as Mike Hoffman potted his 9th power play goal of the season. Dion Phaneuf took a shot from the left point, which took a lucky deflection off Robert Bortuzzo right onto Hoffmanês stick. He made no mistake with the chance after missing a few great opportunities earlier. This now puts Hoffman tied for second place in the league for power play goals, already tying his total from last season. The Sensê power play was a bit odd tonight, as it looked dangerous at times, and sloppy during others. I think this had a lot to do with the difference between the two power play units, as unit one was moving the puck quickly and getting shots off, whereas the second unit was losing the puck a lot more, and didnêt have the same speed of movement that the first unit had.  Just over a minute later, Ryan Dzingel made a sprint towards the net, and Bobby Ryan found the smallest of gaps between Huttonês pad and the left post. The puck slid over the goal line, and all of a sudden, the Sens had a two goal lead. The Blues wouldnêt go out without a fight, though, as Kevin Shattenkirk ripped a wobbling shot from the point that fooled Mike Condon. It was a bit of a weak goal for the Sensê netminder, who had it slip under his blocker without a screen. The goal came with less than a minute left in period two.  Brassard and Steen took matching slashing penalties with 30 seconds left, starting period three at 4-on-4 with the Sens up 3-2. Hereês a fun stat: 44 seconds into the third period, with the play at 4-on-4, number 44 (Pageau) took a slashing penalty against Colton Parayko (who doesnêt wear 44, unfortunately). Seconds after the play switched to 5-on-4, pending UFA Kevin Shattenkirk sent a nice pass over to the recently-exited Alex Steen, who shot the puck past Condon to tie the game. It only took one minute for Ottawa to get their lead back, as Mark Stone would get the puck in the St. Louis zone off a gaffe from Jaden Schwartz. Heêd beat Carter Hutton with a clean wrist shot, with nobody picking up an assist. St. Louis would continue to put shots towards the net, although the Sensê defense was tight enough to keep them towards the outside. Marc Methot made a nice block off the edge of his skate, one of many blocks in this game. Both sides combined for a total 27 shot blocks, including five for Erik Karlsson.  With both goalies already smothered from allowing plenty of goals, the offence continued to pile up. Mike Hoffman got his second goal to make the game 5-3 with six minutes left, and Mark Stone also got his second on an empty netter for the Sensê sixth goal of the game. Patrik Berglund would put one past Condon in the final minute, although it all for nothing as Ottawa held on for the victory. 6-4 was the final score. Sens Hero: The Hoffman-Pageau-Pyatt line The _thirdÓ line actually had the most TOI at 5v5 for Ottawa, and were responsible for two of the Sensê goals. They combined for six points, and showed great chemistry on the nice passing play that led to Hoffmanês second goal. Honourable Mention: Mark Stone Mark Stone is amazing. This just has to be said every time. Sens Zero: The Lazar-Kelly-Neil line They may have only spent seven minutes together, but it was a terrible seven minutes as the Bluesê depth walked all over them. Neil finished with a 5v5 CF% of 30.77%, whereas Lazar and Kelly both finished below 20%.  Honourable Mention: Mike Condon After only allowing more than two goals once in his first four games of 2016, Condon has now allowed four goals in two straight games. Maybe the fatigue of playing so many games is beginning to get to him. Blues Zero: Carter Hutton The Sens seem to be facing a fair amount of backups recently. Maybe it has to do with Condon getting starts? Either way, the Bluesê goalie allowed five goals on 23 shots for a .783 SV%. On a night that was low in shots on goal for both teams, Hutton couldnêt hold it together.  ",St. Louis Game Time,Ottawhat The F*ck Was That?,"Game Highlights: After back to back wins in San Jose and Anaheim, the Blues were back at home to take on the Senators. Three minutes in, guess which team scores first. I'll give you a hint. It wasn't the home team. That's right the Sens take a 1-0 lead thanks to Jean-Gabriel Pageau. The Blues have given up the first goal in 7 straight home games. That's probably not good. Midway through the first period, the Blues tie up the game at one. The Sens had just killed off a penalty. The Blues scored just a few seconds later. Jay Bouwmeester fires a shot that Paul Stastny deflects into the back of the net tying the game at one. Although if Stastny hadn't tipped it in, Schwartz was right there as well. Stastny scores his 11th of the year. Moving forward to the second period, despite the Blues having a small campout in their offensive zone, the Senators would pull ahead by one. This time, while on the powerplay, Mike Hoffman finds a bouncing puck and one times it into the back of the net. The puck actually bounced off of Bortuzzo right to Hoffman. Talk about bad luck. The bad luck gets worse. Minutes (seconds) later the Sens make it 3-1. Bobby Ryan takes advantage of the ref losing his whistle jams the puck out from underneath Hutton and across the line. Could Bouwmeester have done more to keep Ryan out of that position? Yeah, probably, but I'm just a guy writing for a Blues website. t wasn't all doom and gloom for the Blues in the second period. Kevin Shattenkirk blasts the knuckle puck past Mike Condon to pull the Blues to within one at 3-2. It's Shatty's ninth goal of the year. The Blues have a little life heading into the third period. The Blues and Sens played some 4 on 4 hockey to start the third. The Sens were then called for another penalty to make it 4 on 3. The Blues tie the game at three thanks to a returning Steen to the ice. (He was coming back to make it a 5 on 4 powerplay) Kevin Shattenkirk makes a very nice pass that Steen had no problem burying in the back of the net. See, Steen can score goals with an actual goaltender in the net. It's Steen's 6th goal of the year. Just as fast as the Blues tied the game, the Sens untied it. Schwartz turned the puck over, leading to a Mark Stone chance that beats Hutton and it's now back to a 4-3 Sens lead. Mike Hoffman scores his second of the night off a one timer in the sweet spot. It also proves that maybe you shouldn't leave that part of the ice open. 5-3 Sens. Hey Mark Stone, could you go ahead and put us all out of our misery? Thanks. From the  It's probably too late now  department...Patrik Berglund scores with about a minute left off of a Joel Edmundson shot to make it 6-4. Hey at least it'll look good on the stat sheet, am I right? Number 11 for Berglund on the year. Most had already started for the exits at this point Blues lose 6-4. Not sure Allen would have had any better of a chance tonight. The Blues looked great at times and more often than not tonight just made too many bonehead mistakes. Gotta play better if they want to have a chance against their next opponent, the Capitals. See you Thursday night from Drink Scotch. Buy a paper or five. From The Twitter Machine: Blah blah blah...HEY CHRIS WIDEMAN IS FROM ST LOUIS YOU GUYS. Player of the game: Anyone that thinks Star Wars night just needs to go away. Fire it into the sun. At least no one got hurt...Sorry Cardinals.  "
43,1 Regular,1/19/2017,7:00 PM,A,Columbus Blue Jackets,2,0,W,,24,15,4,W 2,28,10,0,4,0,42,22,0,3,0,"15,823",2:33,Senators beat inconsistent Blue Jackets 2-0,"The Columbus Blue Jackets, trailing 2-0 with the clock winding down Thursday night, got a full minute of a 5-on-3 power-play chance. But the NHL's best power-play unit couldn't capitalize, bouncing one of the shots off the post. That was emblematic of the Blue Jackets' night as they lost to the Ottawa Senators 2-0 behind goaltender Mike Condon, who stopped a career-high 42 shots. Kyle Turris and Ryan Dzingel scored goals, and Condon was always where he needed to be for the Senators, who have won four of their last five and handed Columbus its fifth loss in the last eight games. The Blue Jackets got their looks, but shot the puck right at Condon or off target time after time. Eleven Columbus players took multiple shots with nothing to show for it. ""They're a team that loves to throw the puck at the net, and I love those types of games,"" Condon said. ""You don't have time to think, you're just reacting the whole game. You shut your brain off and just play, and that's when I'm at my best. "" Sergei Bobrovsky had 26 saves for the Blue Jackets, who were shut out for the first time since a 5-0 loss at Washington on Jan. 5 to end a franchise-record 16-game winning streak. Turris got a breakaway on a long pass from Erik Karlsson and buried a backhander for his team-leading 16th goal and a 1-0 lead for Ottawa with 3:43 left in the first period. ""It was a gorgeous pass, and I just tried to take it and change it up a little bit on the breakaway,"" Turris said. The Senators got their second goal with 3:48 left in the second period when Dzingel redirected a shot by Chris Wideman from the top of the right circle. Foligno was in the penalty box at the time with a minor for catching Dion Phaneuf in the chops with a high stick. In the third, Columbus' Zach Werenski set up Cam Atkinson with a perfect feed on a breakaway, but the shot from the doorstep was swallowed up by Condon, who then killed the Jackets' 5-on-3 chance. ""I think we had a good feeling all night that we were going to score one. We didn't have lack of chances,"" Columbus defender Jack Johnson said. ""We had a lot of guys with some really good looks at the net, and (Condon) played well. "" Columbus coach John Tortorella said he was frustrated that his team squandered so many chances to climb back into the game on their home ice. ""I don't think we played at the level we need to play at in our building,"" he said. ""I don't think we were awful, but I think when you're in you're in your building, you need to be harder. "" NOTES: Ottawa D Mark Borowiecki was scratched because of the flu going through the locker room. The Senators recalled F Casey Bailey from Binghamton of the AHL in case other players weren't available. Werenski also was fighting the flu, but played. ... D Markus Nutivaara missed his second straight game because of an unspecified injury. He's out indefinitely. ... Ottawa has 19 goals in the past five games. UP NEXT: Ottawa: At Toronto on Saturday. Columbus: Plays Carolina at home on Saturday.  ",Ross A,Condon shuts out Jackets in 2-0 win,"It was one of those nights where everything goes right for the goalie. Other than a puck-over-glass delay-of-game penalty late in the third period, Senators goalie Mike Condon was perfect. The Columbus Blue Jackets peppered him with 42 shots, but none found their way past. Sergei Bobrovsky was nearly his equal in the other net, but the Sens squeaked two past him, leading to a final score of 2-0 that hardly reflected the high-event nature of the game. The starting lineups were uncertain for the Sens because the flu had been making its way through the roster. In the end, Mark Borowiecki was the only one who missed the game, meaning _Steady FreddieÓ Claesson pulled in. Casey Bailey had also been called up, but didnêt actually get to play. The first period opened at a frenetic place. By the first commercial break, each team had seven shots on goal. From there, a penalty kill for each team slowed down the pace a bit. The Jackets had the better chances on their powerplay, but neither team could score. Columbus actually kept it in the Ottawa zone for all except for the final 10 seconds of their powerplay, but they couldnêt even really generate a good chance. A couple minutes after the Sensê powerplay expired though, Erik Karlsson hit Kyle _Gold All In My ChainÓ Turris with a stretch pass that put him on a breakaway. He pulled a sweet forehand-backhand deke that caught Sergei _Youêre Off The CaseÓ Bobrovsky off-guard, leaving Turris with an open net to tuck the puck into. Just like that, the Sens were up by a goal. And that would do it for scoring in the period. The only remaining thing was for the refs to start a mini-theme by giving Karlsson and Brandon Dubinsky offsetting minors. The second period wouldnêt start off great for the Sens. The Jackets would get most of the great chances, but thankfully for Sens fans, Mike _Straight OuttaÓ Condon would stand tall. Scott _Suck It PhaneufÓ Hartnell and Dion _Suck It TorontoÓ Phaneuf would get offsetting minors as well, but that didnêt really favour either team. Then the Sensê penalty drawing would go to work, somehow getting the only two powerplay of the period despite being outshot and having a lead. Columbus would get the best chances on the Sensê powerplays, but again Condon was ready. But then just after the second powerplay expired, Chris _Not DennisÓ Wideman made a great slap-pass in front where both Ryan _No Longer a BuckeyeÓ Dzingel and Derick _Never Was ZibanejadÓ Brassard were waiting. Dzingel got the tip on the puck to put it just out of the reach of Bobrovsky, giving the Sens a two-goal lead theyêd hold to the end of the period. Dzingel actually got another great chance to score, but Bobrovsky made a stellar glove save, and then somehow got his arm flat on the ice to keep the puck out of the net with everybody crashing in. The third period started off well for the Sens, with them getting the first couple shots, but from there it was all desperate Columbus. They poured on the offence, but somehow everything stayed out. Ottawa got another powerplay, when Ryan Murray forgot it was Tom Pyatt on a breakaway so hooked him, but once again, the best chance of the powerplay went to the Jackets. Zach _Calder Winner If He Had Played For The LeafsÓ Werenski hit Cam _Should Be An All-StarÓ Atkinson with a beautiful pass on a 2-on-1, but Condon anticipated the pass and got over to completely cover the play. The Jackets finally got their second powerplay of the game with just five minutes left in the game, when Marc _Always SleevelessÓ Methot was forced into a holding call. Mike Condon decided a powerplay wasnêt challenge enough, so he flipped the puck out of play giving the Jackets a full minute of 5-on-3. He was up to the task, stopping everything. They almost got one by him, but it rang square off the post and then went back between his legs, where he squeezed it for the whistle. I guess if things are going your way, theyêre really going your way. After missing on the 5-on-3, John Tortorella would pull the goalie to keep a 2-player advantage, but it was for nothing. The Sens would hold on, giving Mike Condon a 42-save shutout, his third shutout of the year, and the fourth of his career. Sens Hero: Mike Condon That needless penalty with four minutes left almost cost him this spot, but 42 saves without allowing a single goal almost always gets you a hero nod. Iêve said a couple times that there were games he stood tall without having to make a spectacular save, but this wasnêt one. He made some great saves and was oozing confidence all night. He tracked every rebound, and somehow found the puck when every Columbus forward was simultaneously crashing the net. It was a great performance. Honourable Mention: Ryan Dzingel He had a goal, couldêve had another, and finished with four shots on goal. It looked like he was motivated to make an impression in his college town. Player of Note: Zach Werenski I hadnêt really seen this guy play before, but my goodness can he play. He led seemingly every Jackets attack, and was out there for what mustêve been the last five minutes of the game. He wouldêve been up for Killer status if, you know, the Jackets couldêve scored a goal. Recap Zero: Nicknames Who let this clown write this kind of garbage for a recap anyway?  ",The Cannon,Game Recap: Senators at Blue Jackets,"The Blue Jackets played host to the Ottawa Senators last night in the first of two games in four days between the two teams. The Senators came into the game shorthanded and ill; a large number of Ottawa players were feeling the effects of the flu heading into the game. Dalton Prout would draw into the lineup for Scott Harrington, and Zach Werenski (himself a gametime decision with an illness) would end up cracking the lineup. Sergei Bobrovsky, the league leader in wins, would get the start between the pipes. Ottawa opened with a quick push, generating 3 quick shots on net that Sergei Bobrovsky was able to turn aside with relative ease. The early part of the first period featured a lot of end to end action, but neither team generated a real high danger scoring chance. In positive news, the first line (which Torts has called out repeatedly over the last ten days) looked much better early, generating several shots on Ottawaês net, including a nice backhand option from Brandon Saad. The Jackets earned a power play at 11:10 as Chris Kelly went to the box for hooking. The Jackets might not have scored, but you cannot ask for more. The first unit had 1:40 of offensive zone time and several high quality chances that Mike Condon was able to turn aside. In the end, Ottawa killed the penalty. Immediately after, Josh Anderson went off for slashing at 13:49. Anderson was displeased with the call. The Jackets were fierce on the kill though, actively pressuring every Senators pass. The Jackets killed the penalty, allowing just one shot on goal. On a home run pass, Erik Karlsson hit Kyle Turris who wasted no time burying the breakaway behind Bobrovsky at 16:17. Despite owning play for much of the first period, the Senators opened the scoring tonight. The Senators had caught Columbus on a line change - unfortunate, but the Jackets had to respond. Lukas Sedlak had an excellent chance at the 18:00 mark - Scott Hartnell had picked off a pass and fed Sedlak, but the rookie tipped his shot just wide of the net. Brandon Dubinsky and Erik Karlsson both went off with 90 seconds remaining for dual roughing minors. The Jackets ferociously pressured the Ottawa net for the remainder of the first period, but could not find an equalizer. Despite leading 13-10 in shots, the Jackets trailed 1-0 on the scoreboard. The second period started much the same as the first - lots of end to end action, but no high danger chances for either side. There were a lot of whistles to open the period, and a delay to fetch the puck which had become stuck in the side of the Ottawa net. Scott Hartnell would go to the box for slashing at 3:26, while Dion Phaneuf would go for cross checking, giving these teams their second round of 4 on 4 hockey for the night. The Jackets maintained the bulk of possession (including great work by Jack Johnson), but could not capitalize.  Sergei Bobrovsky made an outstanding stop following a Ryan Murray turnover. To slow Zack Smith down, Josh Anderson took a hooking penalty at 6:51. Murray has not had a strong night thus far, to say the very least. Cam Atkinson had a dangerous shorthanded chance, but was was turned away by Condon as the penalty expired. The Jackets were simply sloppy with the puck - any controlled offensive zone pressure was generating chances, but they werenêt playing with any consistency. Nick Foligno was turned aside on an excellent individual effort. Ottawa was playing a _park the busÓ effort. Ottawa had blocked 13 shots at the halfway mark of the second period. Condon was playing well, but the Jackets were struggling to generate dangerous chances. At 14:08, Nick Foligno went to the box for high sticking Dion Phaneuf. Cam Atkinson had an excellent short handed chance at 15:00 but couldnêt bury it. Shortly after, Ryan Dzingel made it 2-0 on a deflection from the slot. Bobrovsky was helpless on the goal. Jack Johnson had lost his stick and was helpless to do anything. Sergei Bobrovsky is the only reason this game wasnêt 6-0 at intermission. The first and second lines were horrible in the second period. Brandon Saad in particular, who has been completely invisible tonight. 2-0 after 40. Columbus would HAVE to get their legs moving in the third period to have a shot at all. Could they do it? Ottawa opened the third period compleyely in control of the game. They generated the first three shots on goal and generally drove play. At 4:24, Marc Methot turned the puck over leading to an excellent chance for Brandson Saad, but Condon was equal to the chance. Ryan Murray went to the box at 6:21 for hooking to prevent a rush by the Senators. Cam Atkinson was denied on a 2 on 1 shorthanded with Werenski, and Atkinson really should have done better - he was all alone on Condon. Ryan Murray, it cannot be overstated, had a dreadful night. If Nutivaara is okay to play on the weekend, Iêd consider sitting him for a game. But, as bad as heês been, Sergei Bobrovsky has been that good. Heês made save after save from point blank range. Around the ten minute mark, the Blue Jackets finally woke up and started forechecking and playing a simple, straight ahead game. Despite excellent possession, however, the Jackets still would not shoot the puck with authority. The third line made some magic happen, but Josh Anderson was unlucky and hit the post with seven minutes to go. The Jackets drew another penalty with 5:27 to go as Methot went off for holding Foligno. After 59 seconds, Condon threw the puck out of play, giving the Jackets 1:01 of 5 on 3 play. Seth Jones hit the post, but it did not go in. Ottawa killed the 5 on 3, despite several chances.  With 2:43 to go, the Jacket pulled Bobrovsky. Unfortunately, it was not to be. The Jackets were turned aside left and right by Condon, who preserved his shutout. FINAL Ottawa Senators 2 Columbus Blue Jackets 0 THOUGHTS The effort was inexcusable tonight from every single player except Bobrovsky. There was no urgency until there were about 8 minutes to go. That in unacceptable and needs to be addressed going forward. Stick taps to Sergei Bobrovsky for his performance tonight. Itês a shame the skaters could not do any better for him. Ryan Murray was horrible tonight. As I said - when Nutivaara comes back, I am A-ok with benching Murray for Harrington. Iêd be okay never seeing Dalton Prout again, whatever his contract may be. The game has passed him by. Heês slow footed and his hockey sense isnêt where it needs to be. Hopefully the coaching staff and front office can realize this.  I donêt know why Calvert only played 8 minutes tonight. Heês an energy guy and the team needed that tonight. Zach Werenski played well despite being a gametime decision and generated the bulk of the offense for two periods. He continues to impress this season. The Jackets are back at it on Saturday. Hopefully they show more effort this weekend than they did tonight. Iêm not going to lie, this game pissed me off. Probably more than any other this season. The Jackets flat out didnêt show up, didnêt move their legs, were bossed around the ice until there were eight minutes or so remaining in the the game. I donêt know what the problem was or what to adjust going forward, but the 5 on 5 play was horrible. Cam Atkinson was terrible for the most part, outside of two shorthanded chances. I donêt even know what to say. I donêt know if they looked entitled, if they played down to competition, or what, but they didnêt even look like they put forth any effort. Whatever. Carolina at 5:00 on Saturday. Go Jackets.  "
44,1 Regular,1/21/2017,7:00 PM,A,Toronto Maple Leafs,3,2,W,SO,25,15,4,W 3,27,8,1,4,0,33,8,1,4,0,"19,544",2:55,Senators rally to beat Maple Leafs 3-2 in shootout,"Shootouts have been a problem for the Toronto Maple Leafsall season. Mike Hoffman tied the game with 1:11 left in regulation, Tom Pyatt won it with his first career shootout goal and the Ottawa Senators beat Toronto 3-2 on Saturday night. Mitch Marner was the lone Maple Leafs player to beat Ottawa goalie Mike Condon at the other end, where Auston Matthews, James van Riemsdyk and Tyler Bozak were all turned aside as Toronto dropped its NHL-leading sixth game via the tiebreaker (1-6). The Maple Leafs hold the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference standings, but could conceivably be higher than that with a little more success in shootouts. ""I think they need to skew the points a little more,"" van Riemsdyk said after Toronto's second consecutive defeat following three straight wins. ""It seems interesting you can win a shootout and get as many points for beating a team in 60 minutes. I don't think I like that aspect of it. ""It makes it exciting for the fans, so that part of it is good. It has that entertainment value to it, but you should be rewarded more for winning games in regulation. "" The Maple Leafs appeared on their way to victory in regulation when Martin Marincin cleared a puck over the glass and was whistled for delay of game. The Senators scored on the ensuing power play when Hoffman fired a one-timer past Frederik Andersen to tie it at 2. Toronto has struggled to protect third-period leads all season, though coach Mike Babcock thought his team was in good position this time before Marincin's penalty. ""I thought once we got through the first period we were a much better hockey club and played pretty good,"" Babcock said. Toronto was coming off a""terrible"" 5-2 loss to the New York Rangers on Thursday night, as Babcock described it after the Maple Leafs were outshot 41-25. Starting slow against the Senators, who jumped in front on Bobby ryan 's first-period goal, the Maple Leafs rallied with a dominant second period - outshooting Ottawa 15-4 - before taking their first lead on Matt Martin's redirection of a shot by Nazem Kadri (two assists). Andersen gave up a shootout goal to Ryan, stopped both Kyle Turris and Erik Karlsson and then yielded the winner to Pyatt. The 27-year-old goalie hasn't fared particularly well in shootouts since he entered the NHL with Anaheim, his .621 save percentage (25 goals on 66 shots) ranked 44th out of the 50 goalies to face at least 30 shots. ""Throughout a season it's a lot of points if you add them up,"" Andersen said. ""But I think the lesson here is to be able to close them out better. I guess that's the best way to avoid them and get the two points is playing smart in the last minutes of the game. "" Marner has been the most successful Maple Leafs player in shootouts, scoring on three of his seven attempts. Matthews is the only other Toronto player to score a shootout goal this season and he's managed just one on six tries. The other five shooters - van Riemsdyk, Bozak, Kadri, Nikita Soshnikov and Peter Holland - have combined to go empty in nine shots. ""Maybe the other goalies are good and maybe we're not that good at it,"" Babcock said. ""It's just something we'll have to get better at obviously because we've left points (on the table). "" Babcock noted the Maple Leafs practice the shootout ahead of every game. ""I never watch shootouts,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""I never have. Two reasons: One, I hate it. I think it's a team game, and it should be decided by team play. But I understand that the game has got to end. The other thing, two, is I got into a habit of not looking. It makes no difference if I look or not so I let the guys do their thing. "" Now 4-1 in shootouts this season, Ottawa finished 3-0 on its road trip to St. Louis, Columbus and Toronto. The Senators have won four of their last five overall and sit second in the Atlantic Division with 54 points - three up on the Maple Leafs. Pyatt hadn't scored in his first two career shootout attempts. He thought he got another chance Saturday because he went 4 for 4 during a recent shootout tournament at practice. ""I guess the coaches remembered that,"" he said. The Maple Leafs have never fared well in shootouts since their introduction. The club has 66 such defeats, trailing only the Florida Panthers (80) and Philadelphia Flyers (74). Toronto's goalies have posted a collective .623 save percentage in that span, better than only the Flyers (.599). NOTES: Marincin returned from an 18-game absence due to a lower-body injury. ... The Senators appeared to lose Chris Kelly to an injury when he was tripped in the defensive zone by Leo Komarov and landed awkwardly on the ice. Kelly, however, returned for the third period. UP NEXT Senators: Host the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday. Maple Leafs: Host the Calgary Flames on Monday night.  ",Ary M,#TheSystem prevails as Sens down Leafs 3-2 in the shootout,"Itês Guy Boucherês world - weêre all just living in it. Many - including myself - were wondering how the team would play tonight. Despite two convincing wins earlier this week, the Sens lost to the Leafs last Saturday and were feeling blue after getting the news that Clarke MacArthur would be out for the rest of the year. What happened? The team showed their character and tied the game in the last two minutes of the third before winning in the shootout.  The first started off slowly, with 11 whistles in the first 8 minutes and the team going 0/2 on two first-period Nikita Zaitsev penalties. When the pace picked up, it was Chris Neil (!) who made the key offensive play. On the ice with Kyle Turris and Bobby Ryan, #25 entered the zone wide on the left side but was bottled nicely by Jake Gardiner. However, instead of giving up on the play, Neil stuck with the puck and cycled it back to Marc Methot   who then wired it on net just as Ryan and Turris are flying by. Bobby managed to get a stick on it for the first goal of the game, and Neilês first point in his last 29 (!).   On the shift after the goal, Methot   who had a big impact on the game tonight at EV and the PK   took an interference penalty wherein the Leafs generated a number of chances. They play an extremely fast 1-3-1, but Mike Condon was up to the task.  The second period was dismal for the Senators, as the Leafs not only outshot them 15-4, but tied the game up. With Dion Phaneuf off for slashing after Zach Hyman turned him around in transition, the Leafs PP cashed in on a perfect Tyler Bozak shot. When you see the goal, your immediate reaction may be to blame Methot for not getting the puck out, but with the Ottawa native smothered by three Leafs forwards down low, itês only natural for him to turn it over.   With the game tied, the Leafs kept pushing. I wouldnêt say that the teamês structure ever faltered   the Leafs only had 4 high-danger scoring chances in the period   but instead, I would say that the Sens were ineffective offensively. They donêt seem to make one big mistake but instead, start to make a lot of little ones. It starts with things like Condon rimming the puck around the boards to no one, or a failed zone exit after giving the puck up without control. These little things then lead to getting hemmed in by the Hyman - Matthews - Brown line, or breakdowns in transition   especially by Phaneuf - Ceci who were a mess down low tonight   which are bigger worries. The Leafs end up taking the lead on one of those little plays   a bobble of the puck after a hard dump in and an inability to clear Matt Martin in front of the net, 7 minutes into the third period. Itês a soft goal on Condon, who faced 33 shots on the night, but one thatês allowable given the number of strong stops he made all night.   Itês at this point where the team starts to wake up and take advantage of a Leafs squad who went into _defend the leadÓ mode, with Wideman, Stone, Hoffman, and Turris all getting prime chances on Fredrik Andersen. All-in-all, the Sens won the high-danger scoring chance battle 7-6 tonight at 5-on-5, but it was a dormant powerplay that finally cashed in to tie the game. Facing the leagueês fourth ranked PK squad on their fourth powerplay attempt, Erik Karlsson and Mike Hoffman connect on a shot that squeaks through Andersenês five hole. The Leafs end up challenging the play   claiming Bobby Ryan interfered with Andersen   but itês clear on the replay that Ryanês screen was picture perfect.   Overtime was choppy, with defenders Karlsson and Wideman getting the best chances for Ottawa while Kadri and Matthews had a pair of chances on Condon. The shootout was a different story, though, with Condon absolutely robbing Matthews on his first attempt while Ryan and Pyatt (!) scored for the Senators to win in the fourth round. Sens Hero: Mike Condon I donêt know how he keeps doing it, but Condon was fantastic again tonight. Looking at the heatmap for tonight shows that Leafs got to the front of the net more than the Senators, but despite the one softie on Martin, Condon stood tall. Nylander and Hyman were both robbed on sure goals in the second and third periods, and the shootout save on Matthews was a thing of beauty. With the team playing at 5:00pm tomorrow, I hope Condon gets a well-deserved rest.  Sens Killer: Zach Hyman Every time we play the Leafs, a different thorn appears. Tonight, it was Hyman, who was a pest all night around the net on his way to a strong night in terms of the shot metrics. Hyman was also a big part of the Leafs PK who were aggressive on the Sens all night.  Erik Karlsson moment: just because     ",Pension Plan Puppet,Leafs 2 - Sens 3 (SO),"Another Saturday night, another Leafs vs Sens game to bring to you, this time from the ACC. How will Auston Matthews make Erik Karlsson look foolish tonight? Only one way to find out. First Period [20:00] For the Leafs, Martin Marincin draws in for Frank Corrado. The former has been out with injury for a while, but you get the sense that even if he was still on crutches, Babcock might prefer him to Corrado. Looks like the defence pairs will be as normal for the Leafs, but with Marincin slotting in directly where Rielly normally would be. [20:00] Goalies are Condon and Andersen. Freddie has started 37 of the Leafs 44 games.  [19:45] Last week, Ottawa tried to match up J.G Pageauês line against Matthewsê. Will be interesting to see how this changes with the Leafs at home. [18:50] Matthews bursts through the line and snaps a shot on net. He can get that thing off in a hurry. Relatively easy save for Condon though. [17:38] I assume he played last week, but I was not aware Chris Kelly was still in the league. [17:15] Very disjointed start from both teams. Lots of stoppages and sloppy play. [16:15] Matthews gave it away in the neutral zone, but got it right back to rescue the Leafs. No real chances either way. Like I said, itês disjointed. [15:30] Ottawa tweaks their fourth line slightly and puts Stone on it for a ship, to try and exploit Babcockês habit of matching fourth lines against one another. [14:50] And right on cue, Stone picks the pocket of Carrick, dangles Gauthier, and sets up a chance in the offensive zone. [14:10] Zaitsev hooks a Sen as the puck squirts free in front. Leafs to the PK. [13:31] Ottawa with great control and puck movement, but not many shots. [12:55] As I say that, they catch the Leafs napping and Ryan Dzingel breaks in on goal, totally unmolested. Andersen makes the save, and the leafs kill the power play. [11:14] Marner just always seems to find the little creases in a defense. His positioning is sublime. He gets on the end of two great chances, but he overpasses one, and flubs the other.  [9:44] The game finally opens up a little bit, but Zaitsev high sticks a Sen, and Ottawa gets another chance to open the scoring.  [9:22] Gauthier is really endearing himself to Babcock with his faceoff prowess, at least in this game. [8:51] Ottawaês PP is really humming. Moving the puck around with ease, and are unlucky to have not scored already. [7:43] The Leafs kill it off again. They need to generate something offensively. [6:00] Ottawa scores! After Gardiner foils a Sens rush, the puck makes its way back to Methot at the point, and his shot is deflected by Bobby Ryan off the post and in. 1-0 Senators. [5:55] After the ensuing faceoff, Methot takes a penalty. Leafs will have a chance to answer on the PP. [5:28] The Leafs are a total mess right now. Not able to get anything set up. [4:59] They finally do get a setup, and Matthews misses and empty net after a JVR shot. Looks like he wasnêt expecting it. [4:02] Better from the Leafs - but still no goals, unfortunately. [1:31] Kadriês line gets some zone pressure, but a rush going the other way leads to a huge scramble around the net. Komarov takes a penalty for hooking to prevent a scoring chance. Leafs to the PK again. [0:53] More of the same. Sens PP looking dangerous, Andersen stymying them. If the Leafs go into the second only down one, they have their goalie to thank. [0:00] They do manage to get to the end of the period unscathed. Theyêll still have about 30 seconds to kill off at the start of the 2nd. Overall, a poor period from Toronto. Needs to be better if theyêre going to come back. They generated very little in the way of strong chances. Second Period [20:00] We start the period with the Leafs on the PK.  [19:31] They manage to do so, and need to set up some offence now. [18:42] Seriously, the Leafs look so terrible right now. Canêt get the puck off Ottawa at all. [17:31] Marner seems to be the most awake Leaf. Heês all over the offensive zone, and narrowly misses out on getting an assist as he sets up Matthews for a shot. [15:20] The Leafs offense is almost entirely coming from the Bozak line now. Kadriês group has been relatively quiet. [14:31] Kadriês line ices it twice. Unable to get a clean breakout and entry going.  [13:58] Hyman takes a great feed from Matthews and beats Phaneuf wide, who is forced to take a penalty. The Leafs head to the PP. [13:37] Nylander has also been quite active today. Generates a nice shot off the rush on the PP. [12:29] The Leafs score! And itês the hot PP that does it. Kadri gets the puck down low to JVR, who feeds Bozak in the slot for the goal. Very Columbus-like, using the threat of the puck below the goal line to generate a great chance and goal. 1-1 tie. [11:46] The crowd is into it now. Was quite sleepy prior to the goal. [11:26] And now the Leafs are into it too, as a strong shift from Matthewsê group leads to some chances. [10:44] The fourth line is getting in on it too. Big increase in the level of play from the Leafs in the last three minutes or so. [9:44] Carrick with a patented blind pass to no one leading to a rush from the Sens into the Leafs zone. As the play progresses, Kelly gets tangled up awkwardly with Komarov, and falls oddly. He appears to hit his head on the ice. Letês see how the concussion protocol treats this.  [8:15] Very pretty play from the Leafs, as consecutive cross-ice passes from Matthews, Gardiner, and Brown lead to a shot right in front of the net. Unfortunately, the one taking it is Hyman. [5:48] Carrick really needs to be babysat by Jake. Another lazy pass in the neutral zone leads to a 3-on-1 for Ottawa, that very fortunately doesnêt work out for the Sens. [5:32] As the play goes the other way, Hyman draws a high-sticking penalty. Itês a double minor too, since Hyman bleeds as a result. I guess heês easy to puncture. [5:25] BTW, itês ridiculously stupid that the length of the power play is determined by whether the victim bleeds or not. [3:45] Not a tonne of great shots from the Leafs. Lots getting blocked by Ottawa. [2:29] Really strong PK from Ottawa here. Not getting baited out with the Leafs movement or misdirection.  [1:38] Ottawa has essentially killed off the entire penalty now. Huge kill for them. [0:00] The rest of the period passes without incident. On to the third we go, in a tie game. Third Period [18:51] Gardiner gets tripped by Smith, which opens up a lane for Mark Stone to come out from the corner and get a shot off. No harm done for the Leafs though. [17:30] Some pressure and shots for the Matthews line, who are really dominating as this game progresses. They refuse to let Ottawa leave the zone easily. [16:28] I feel like the Leafs fourth line has a lot of territorial advantage, but they canêt turn their good board play into shots and chances from high quality areas of the ice.  [15:50] Marner gets hit in the neutral zone, but in the process, his turbo button is pressed, and he spends the rest of the shift moving like a man possessed. No danger arises though. Overall, there havenêt been a lot of real quality chances. [14:05] JVR streaks in on a nice pass from Bozak, and nearly pots one by Condon on the snapper.  [13:19] Again, the fourth line spends about 30 seconds deep in the Senators zone, but get precisely 0 shots. [12:59] And Iêm proven wrong, as Matt Martin gives the Leafs a lead. After a shoot-in, Kadri walks in from the wall and fires on net. It deflects off Martin and a fortunate bounce gives the Leafs a 2-1 lead. [12:03] Immediately after, Kadri and Nylander get a 2-on-1, where Condon absolutely ROBS Willie. Absolutely filthy glove save.  [12:03] Nylander has gotten so unlucky at even strength this year. Sean Tierney of the Athletic had a nice visual about expected goals and first assists (based on passing data from Ryan Stimson), and Nylander was one of the league leaders. Heês been ridiculous, and when the percentages start working in his favour that will be made evident.  [10:30] Nylander sets up another nice chance, on a cross-ice pass to Komarov, but his slapshot misses the target. [9:53] Ottawa really pushing right now, as expected. The Leafs seem to be really poor with a lead. Just totally shelled up right now. [8:50] Ottawaês pressure is basically amounting to point shots with a lot of traffic in front. Which isnêt the worst thin in the world for the Leafs, but if that keeps happening, one will go in eventually. [6:33] Leafs progressing to neutral zone play now, as a long swath of play occurs with no real events for either team. [4:30] Toronto isnêt generating much, but every shift they burn is 30-45 seconds closer to a win. [3:57] Oh wow, great save by Andersen. After the Sens dump it in, the puck is poked free in front, and the Sensê Wideman is the first to get to it, and shoots from point blank range.  [3:10] That the Matthews line is still able to generate offence at this stage of the game, with Ottawa pressing is really crazy. They get a few more chances. [2:47] Oooh, Marincin takes a delay of game penalty for shooting the puck out of the zone. Totally incidental, and the Sens have a golden chance to tie the game. [2:27] This is really nerve-wracking now. Going to be a lot of pressure from hereon out. [1:11] Aaand, they tie it. As they take off the goalie for the extra man, a point shot deflects off Hunwick, but unfortunately goes through the five-hole of Andersen. 2-2 tie. [0:40] Ottawa ices it, and maybe Toronto has a glimmer of hope to end this in regulation. [0:00] Thereês a mad scramble in front of the net as time expires, and I legitimately have no clue what happened and how the Senators didnêt score. It looks like it was cleared off the line by Matthews. So we head to OT. Overtime [4:35] Karlsson shot from the slot that Andersen manages to snare.  [4:04] Slow start to the OT, but I imagine it will pick up in short order. [3:36] Komarov and Kadri have a 2-on-1, but Kadri fans on the shot! Great chance to end it there. [2:44] The Sens come the other way and blast a shot off the post.  [2:14] Relatively sleepy, as far as OT goes. Some great defensive plays on both ends. [1:19] Matthews, Brown, and Gardiner get a truckload of chances, but Sens sticks or Condon come in the way. [0:48] Karlsson has a brilliant end to end rush, which leads to a Hoffman shot from the slot. Not sure if that got blocked or deflected, but it doesnêt go in, which I suppose is all that matters. [0:00] And we head to a shootout Shootout Matthews shoots first for Toronto. Robbed by Condon on the backhand.  Ryan up for Ottawa. He scores on a nifty backhand-forehand move. 1-0 Ottawa. Marner now for the Leafs. And he evens it up, but Condon really doesnêt like it. Marner slowed up and arguably pulled it back. Itês under review now. Aaaand ... itês good! 1-1 tie in the shootout. Up comes Turris, and Andersen steals it with the glove! Still tied.  JVR with a chance to give the Leafs a lead.....and his backhander misses the net. Now Erik Karlsson... saved! We go to extra shooters. Bozak canêt do it either, and Ottawa with another chance to end it. Which they do. Tom Pyatt puts it past Andersen, and the Leafs lose in the skills competition  "

Atkinson's second goal of the game at 1:09 of overtime gave the Columbus Blue Jackets a 7-6 win over the Ottawa Senators on Sunday night. The 27-year-old winger found himself on a breakaway after a shot by Senators captain Erik Karlsson missed the Columbus net and went around the boards out to Atkinson, who was at center-ice. Atkinson deked Mike Condon and slid the puck past the sprawled goaltender on the forehand to earn his team the two points. ""I was anticipating when he was about to shoot it and luckily he just missed the net and I got a breakaway and I just went to my go-to,"" Atkinson said. ""I thought we played pretty well and it was a good win. "" The Blue Jackets trailed 5-3 after two periods before Lukas Sedlak and Matt Calvert scored 31 seconds apart to tie it less than 2 1/2 minutes into the third. ""We wanted to respond in the third as fast as possible and although it wasn't exactly how we drew it up it was a good gut check by our team,"" said Columbus' Scott Harrington, who had a goal and an assist. Atklnson then gave Columbus a 6-5 lead with 9:10 remaining as his shot was deflected up in the air and Senators goalie Mike Condon tried to catch it above his head but the puck hit his glove and went in the goal. ""It was a tough goal, but those things happen. It was a routine play and (the puck) just got tipped up in the air and I made a mistake. It happens,"" Condon said. Kyle Turris then tied it for Ottawa on the power play less than 2 minutes later. Nick Foligno, Scott Harrington and Zach Werenski also scored for the Blue Jackets, and Joonas Korpisalo finished with 28 saves. Zach Smith and Mike Hoffman each had two goals and Mark Stone also scored for the Senators. Mike Condon had 22 saves. The teams combined for three goals and three penalties over the first 5 1/2 minutes of the game. Smith put Ottawa up 1-0 when he banked a shot off Korpisalo's pad and in at 42 seconds. Just 34 seconds later, and only 12 seconds after Cody Ceci took a hooking penalty, Foligno tied the game as he tipped a pass by Alex Wennberg in behind Condon. Smith scored his second of the game at 5:33 on a redirection. Curtis Lazarpicked up the second assist giving him his first point of the season in his 25th game. ""That was different and I think a bit of that has to do with both teams having a bit of a busy schedule and playing back-to-back games and I think the mental fatigue kicks in,"" Smith said of the fire-wagon type hockey that was played. ""There's a few more missed assignments and mental errors. Neither team can use that as an excuse because they're both in the same boat, but realistically that's part of it. "" After a bit of a lull, Harrington scored his first goal of the season when his point shot eluded Condon at 10:18 and tied it 2-2. Harrington, from nearby Kingston, Ontario, said his parents were among the family and friends in the crowd to witness it. ""It worked out well I guess,"" he said. ""Hometown is only about two hours from here so I've got some cousins here, my sister lives here and family friends as well, so it worked out well. "" The second period wasn't as explosive to start as the first, but there was an opening-minute penalty to the Senators and a power-play goal by Werenski at 56 seconds to give the Blue Jackets a 3-2 lead. The Senators scored three times to take a 5-3 lead by the end of the period. Hoffman and Stone scored 2:27 apart to put Ottawa ahead with 6:52 to go, and Hoffman made it a two-goal game with 17 seconds left. NOTES: Casey Bailey and Mark Boroweicki were scratches for the Senators. ... Marcus Hannikainen, David Savard and Markus Nitivaara were scratches for the Blue Jackets. ... Senators F Turris played in his 500th NHL game and became the 1,505th player in league history to reach that milestone. UP NEXT Blue Jackets: At the New York Islanders on Tuesday night in the second of five straight road games. Senators: Host Washington on Tuesday night in the middle game of a three-game homestand.  ",Colin4000,Sens lose 7-6 to Jackets in OT on wild night,"In one of the Ottawa Senatorsê craziest games of the year, they came up just short, losing to the Columbus Blue Jackets 7-6 in overtime. The offense came out firing for both teams tonight, with the Jackets edging out the Sens on the scoreboard. Both teams were on the tail end of a back-to-back, with Mike Condon making yet another start. The first period started off fast for both teams, as Zack Smith scored on the first shot of the game. A Cody Ceci shot went wide of the net, and made a slow rebound off the boards which confused Jacketsê goaltender Joonas Korpisalo. A small shift to the right opened up a gap for Zack Smith on the doorstep, who tucked the puck away 42 seconds into the game. Moments after scoring his first point in six games, Cody Ceci went to the box for hooking. Columbus took advantage right away, with Nick Foligno potting his 16th of the season off a nice feed from Alexander Wennberg in tight. It was Columbusê second shot of the game, tying things up quickly. With plenty of scouts from other teams in attendance tonight, this game was a good opportunity for the Sens to showcase some of their potential trading pieces. Pending UFA Zack Smith scored his second of the period off a Cody Ceci shot, with Curtis Lazar picking up the secondary assist. Thatês right, Curtis Lazar finally scored his first point of the season, in his 25th game. Sens leading 2-1 after only 5:33 of play, with Zack Smith already looking for a hat trick. A couple minutes later, Columbus went to the power play off Pageau penalty for goaltender interference. The Sens were able to kill it off without facing much pressure, as Tom Pyatt made some key defensive plays to maintain the lead. That lead wouldnêt last much longer, however, as former Leaf Scott Harrington took a shot from the point that sailed past a quadruple-screened Condon. It was his first career NHL goal (of course), scoring it with his family in attendance. Keep in mind that at this point, weêre only halfway through the first period. The Sens got their first power play of the game off a Hartnell slashing call, and the Sens had a couple fantastic chances. Derick Brassard made a fantastic spinning backhand pass right to Zack Smith on the doorstep, who wouldêve scored a natural hat trick had Seth Jones not blocked it with his leg. The play was very similar to Sidney Crosbyês pass to Conor Shearyfrom a couple nights ago, as Brassard was dangerous all night.  Period one ended tied 2-2, with Zack Smith registering five shots on goal in the first 20 minutes. Sens led in shots 10-8. Ottawaês had a couple fantastic periods in their recent stretch of games, and tonightês second period is definitely up there. Columbus struck early off a Werenski power play goal less than a minute in, although it would all be Ottawa after that. On the power play, the Sens generated chance after chance, with Mike Hoffman and Kyle Turris both getting fantastic looks. After Columbusê penalty concluded, Jean-Gabriel Pageaufound Mike Hoffman at the top of the circle who made no mistake in sniping it past a stunned Korpisalo. The Senators would strike again at the 13 minute mark as Mark Stone buried a rebound off a shot from Derick Brassard. It was a poor play by Korpisalo, who finished the night with a .824 SV%. Tonight was only his third start of the season. Ottawa would strike again late in the period, with Mike Hoffman sniping another one bar-down for his 17th goal of the season. It was a perfectly placed shot, with a perfect release, and a velocity that probably makes Korpisalo glad it didnêt hit him. All of a sudden, Ottawa had a two goal leading heading into the final frame off of three unanswered goals. The momentum was in Ottawaês favour heading into second intermission. That momentum was cut off quickly by Columbus in the third, as Lukas Sedlak scored on a breakaway past Wideman and Phaneuf 1:50 into period three. Matt Calvert would get another one for the Jackets 31 seconds later, tipping a Seth Jones shot from the point. Mike Condon didnêt have a very strong night, as a large portion of Columbusê goals either slid underneath or sailed right by him. Then there was this...  Right off the faceoff, a Cam Atkinson shot seemingly deflected off of Bobby Ryanês stick, leaping over a standing Mike Condon and into the back of the net. Was it a lazy play by Condon? Yes. Could we have won the game had he stopped it? Maybe. Either way, itês an unfortunate play that summed up the less-than-stellar night for Ottawaês goaltender. Maybe itês time to give Driedger a start? Columbus took the lead off three unanswered, leading 6-5. The Sens werenêt done yet, though. In his 500th career NHL game, and his family in attendance, Kyle Turris scored his 17th of the season on a power play after coming close on many chances earlier. It was another weak goal for the Columbus goalie, trickling right through him and the post. The game headed into overtime tied 6-6, with Smith and Hoffman looking for a hat trick.  OT didnêt go quite as planned for Ottawa. Erik Karlsson made an incredible dash end-to-end, flying past Columbus players left and right. His shot went over the net and rebounded right to Cam Atkinson, springing him on a breakaway. He made no mistake, scoring to take the extra point for Columbus.  Sens Heroes: The forwards Everybody in the top nine helped out tonight. Zack Smith finished with two goals and one assist, Brassard and Pageau had two assists each, and Mike Hoffman had his two snipes. Mark Stone, Kyle Turris, Tom Pyatt and Curtis Lazar all contributed with key plays as well. Honourable Mention: Cody Ceci Although he wasnêt the ice time leader tonight, Cody Ceci finished the game with two assists, two shots on goal and a 57% CF%.  Honourable Mention: Erik Karlsson Despite finishing a minus-three, Karlsson had an assist on the final goal as well as four shots. Plus that play in overtime was a thing of beauty. Sens Killers: Alexander Wennberg and Zach Werenski Wennberg played a key part in Columbusê win, finishing the night with three assists. Werenski unfortunately had to leave the ice after blocking a shot midway through the third period, although he was a threat whenever he touched the ice.  ",The Cannon,Stealing Points is Fun,"Hey. So. What the hell just happened? In one of those games that can only be described as _neither team decided to play defense tonight and everything that was thrown at the net went in, the Blue Jackets somehow managed to claw back from a 2 goal deficit, blow a late lead, and still came out of this game with two important points, maintaining their stance in the Eastern Conference and keeping pace with the league leading Washington Capitals. Iêm not going to bother diving into the nitty gritty details of this game because, frankly, thereês not much fans can draw from a game like this. Condon, after a sensational effort on Thursday, coughed up seven goals tonight. Cam Atkinson was yanked from the power play and responded with two goals, including the game winner in overtime. in happy news, Zach Werenski is healthy. He took a shot off the inside of his ankle, was checked out and cleared by trainer Mike Vogt (who said he had no break in his leg) and returned to the game. Luckily there are only two games ahead of the All Star Break, so Werenski will have some time to heal. I would not be shocked to see him scratched on Tuesday as a result. Seven to six. Victory. What? I mean, really, thereês not much to take from this game. You canêt pin thos on Korpisalo, who was hung out to dry several times tonight. Cam Atkinson needed a spark and scored two goals. He needed the inspiration. Per Kristyn Repke of Fanrag, the CBJ are 20-2-2 when Sam Gagner registers a point. He has had an exceptional season thus far, and it is my hope that he is re-signed this offseason. Scott Harrington scored his first goal tonight in front of his parents and sister, which is exceptional. Great for him. Alex Wennberg registered 3 assists tonight, extending his team lead. Camês two goals extended his team lead in goals and points. This team has a little momentum heading into the All Star Break. Back at it on Tuesday in New York against the Islanders. Go Jackets.  "

Condon stopped 31 shots for his fourth shutout of the season, leading the Senators to a 3-0 victory over the Capitals on Tuesday night. The goalie had been solid in the two previous meetings, 2-1 and 1-0 losses, but was happy to finally come out with a victory against the league's top team. ""We've had some good defensive efforts and finally we were able to knock them off,"" Condon said. ""It's one of the hottest teams in the league and I thought we did a really great job all around. "" Chris Kelly, Bobby Ryan and Zack Smith scored for the Senators, who improved to 6-1-1 in their last eight. Phillipp Grubauer made 31 saves as the Capitals lost in regulation for the first time since Dec. 27 at the New York Islanders. They were 12-0-2 since. Washington was shut out for the third time this season, and first since a 3-0 loss to the Islanders at home on Dec. 1. ""We couldn't get a spark to get any energy on our bench,"" Capitals coach Barry Trotz said. ""We had a pretty good run so we'll have to start a new one. "" Several Washington players had point streaks end, including Alex Ovechkin's eight-game run with four goals and nine assists.. Jean-Gabriel Pageau was on Ovechkin for much of the night and the Senators' diminutive center frustrated the Capitals' captain all night. ""It was a big challenge for all of us and I think we answered well and played a good game,"" Pageau said. ""(Ovechkin's) a player that competes really hard. That's why he's a great player, he's their captain, he's their leader and I was just trying to compete as hard as him and battling as hard as him and I think we did a good job of containing him. "" Senators coach Guy Boucher raved about Pageau calling him a""coach's dream. """"It doesn't matter what you ask him, he just does it,"" Boucher said. ""At his size what he's been doing, what he's giving to our team is extremely inspiring. "" Nicklas Backstrom, playing his 700th NHL game saw his 10-game point streak (four goals, 13 assists) end. Trailing 3-0 to start the third the Capitals failed to create any real challenge for the Senators and were caught giving up a breakaway chance to Pageau short-handed. Ottawa's special teams continued to be the difference in the game as Smith scored a power-play goal midway through the second as Smith redirected Ryan Dzingel's shot to give the Senators a 3-0 lead. Ottawa couldn't have asked for a better start as they scored twice in the first period. Kelly opened the scoring with a short-handed goal at 1:46. Less than three minutes later, Ryan made it 2-0 as he tipped Fredrik claesson 's shot past Grubauer. The Capitals struggled to regroup following Ottawa's two goals and were never able to match the Senators' intensity. ""Give them credit, they played a solid game all night,"" Washington's Taylor Chorney said. ""Anytime we were getting any momentum going we couldn't sustain it and they did a good job sticking with their game plan. "" Prior to the start of the game the Senators inducted Bryan Murray into its Ring of Honour. Murray is the first inductee. His portrait is featured on a pillar in the 300 Level of the Canadian Tire Centre. Murray spent time as both coach and general manager with the Senators and is now a senior hockey advisor with the organization. The 74-year-old made his NHL coaching debut with the Capitals in 1981 and spent 8 1/2 seasons with the organization. His 343 wins remain a Capitals record. NOTES: The Senators were without LW Mike Hoffman and D Mark Borowiecki as the flu continues to run rampant through the team. Casey Bailey was recalled from Binghamton of the AHL to replace Hoffman. ... The Capitals were without D John Carlson (lower body) and C Jay Beagle (flu). UP NEXT Capitals: At New Jersey on Thursday night. Senators: Host Calgary on Thursday night.  ",Beata Elliott,Sens Shut Down Capitals In 3-0 Win,"Over the last few years, itês felt like the Senators have been stuck in a state of perpetual mediocrity, as every stretch of good hockey has felt more like a flash in the pan than an actual indicator of long-term success. And while thatês been fun, itês also gotten tiring, as our recent attendance woes would suggest. Iêm not going to say that this yearês team looks like the real deal just yet, but this is the first time in awhile that Iêve felt like Iêve been watching a legitimately good hockey team, not just one thatês banking off a stretch of good luck. Theyêve been playing consistent, solid hockey. No crazy back-and-forth, no relying on a 40-save shutout from their goaltender. #TheSystem seems to be working. This game was the perfect example of that, as the Sens calmly contained the best team in the NHL on their way to a decisive win. The Capitals are always a tough team to play against, but the Sens were up to the challenge, matching Washingtonês energy and physicality right from the start. The first period featured a number of good offensive chances for both teams. A Dion Phaneuf slash against Alexander Ovechkin led to a Caps power play, which looked particularly dangerous when Guy Boucher inexplicably decided to put Kelly and Pyatt on the ice shorthanded. Did I say inexplicably? That was a typo. Boucher clearly knows something about Tom Pyattthat the rest of us donêt, because for the second time in three games, the fourth liner surprised everyone with a nifty play leading to a Sens goal. Chris Kelly was credited with his third goal of the season, on a night when many were wondering if he would end up being relegated to the press box to make room for recent acquisition Tommy Wingels.  It was particularly fitting that Kelly score tonight, seeing as the Sens were celebrating the legacy of his former coach, Bryan Murray. The Capitals nearly evened the score on a Winnik breakaway, but it was deftly shut down by noted Defensive Defenseman Erik Karlsson, with a bit of help from Mike Condon. Ottawa took a two-nothing lead when Bobby Ryan tipped in a Freddy Claesson shot for his eleventh of the season. Thereês no denying that Ryanês been having an off year, but heês definitely stepped up his game recently. That assist was also Claessonês second of the night, tying him in points with Mark Borowiecki. Itês at the point now where there are very few arguments for keeping Boro in the lineup, and Guy Boucher should seriously consider having Claesson replace him for good. He probably wonêt, because leadership, but he should. Considering that the Sens had only given up one goal in two games against the Capitals this season, it seemed inevitable that this game would end up being a high-scoring one. A two goal lead is, after all, the worst lead in hockey, and Washington is simply too good to be held to fewer than two goals three times in a row. However, Ottawa continued their strong play in the second period, creating a few offensive chances and even managing to outshoot their opponents. Despite occasional defensive lapses, they successfully prevented Washington from scoring for another 20 minutes. An Ottawa powerplay led to a goal from Zack Smith, in his first game since signing a new 4 year contract. Ryan Dzingel did most of the work, showing off his stickhandling skills before sending it to the front of the net for a Smith deflection. Things were looking up as the Sens went into the third period up 3-0 over the number one team in the league. There isnêt much to say about the third, except that #TheSystem continued to do its job as the Sens held on for the shutout win. Was it perfect? No. Did Condon bail the team out a few times? Sure. Did they get some help from Washingtonês backup goalie? Absolutely. But against the top team in the league, Iêll take it. Sens Hero: Ryan Dzingel Heês had a serious case of Erik Condra syndrome lately, but his speed and hands were both on full display in this game, as he set up the third goal and got a number of top-notch chances that he didnêt quite manage to bury. He also played through the flu which, according to my calculations, makes him tougher than Mark Borowiecki. Honourable Mention: Mike Condon I was a bit worried about him after his mediocre performance against Columbus, but Condon bounced back with an excellent game against the Capitals. Itês incredible that heês been able to play so well in so many consecutive games. He should get some rest in the coming week, though, as the team will get a few days off and Anderson is due to return soon.  Honourable Mention: Fredrik Claesson Iêve been a fan of Freddyês since his first game in Ottawa, and his play these last few games has only made me like him more. Not only is he steady and reliable in the defensive zone, heês also started to show a bit of offensive flair. Honourable Mention: Jean-Gabriel Pageau The Sensê entire bottom six really stepped up in Mike Hoffmanês absence. Pageau was especially noticeable, playing with his usual tenacity and even getting a few chances in the offensive zone, including a shorthanded breakaway. Itês worth noting that Pageau also did a good job of distracting and shutting down Alex Ovechkin.  ",Japers' Rink,Sens Slay Caps 3-0,"The Washington Capitals looked every bit the jet-lagged visitor capping off a back-to-back on Tuesday night, watching a fourteen-game point streak die and getting shutout for just the third time all season. Curse ye, vexing Canada! Here's Tuesday night's Plus/Minus: Plus: With this regulation loss, the Capitals drop their first game in the originally-designated sixty minutes in fifteen games, falling to 12-1-2. Minus: Poor stick discipline, the hallmark of tired teams and soon-to-be unemployed porn stars, plagued the Capitals tonight. Ten more notes on the game: 1. The Washington Capitals finished their 6-1 blowout of the Carolina Hurricanes around 9:30 PM on Monday night. Would they be ready for a tilt against the Ottawa Senators some scant twenty hours later, nearly 600 miles away? (Spoiler Alert: No.) 2. The Capitals went to the power play just thirty seconds into the game. But then Ottawaês Chris Kelly suffered unto Washington the ultimate embarrassment: a shorthanded goal. It was 1-0 Senators. 3. Then, just two minutes later in front of the cold and probably vaguely poutine-smelling Ottawa crowd, Bobby Ryan ripped one past Philipp Grubauer to make it 2-0 Senators. 4. The vaulted Capitals penalty kill, the third best in the league before tonight, then sacrificed a dinger to the Ottawa onslaught, as Zack Smith popped home a setup on the man advantage. 5. Prayers and crystals out for Dmitry Orlov, who caught a high stick in the face from an Ottawa ruffian that looked.....well, I ainêt sayinê he meant to do it, but I ainêt sayinê he ainêt meant to, either. Orlov was visibly shaken up, but would return to the game. 6. That would be it for the scoring, and the buzzer would sound on a 3-0 shutout for the home team. 7. As Alan May pointed out on Twitter, the Capitals really missed Jay Beagle in this game, who was out with an illness (presumably allergic to second-rate national capitals). Chandler Stephenson got the jersey instead, proudly rocking the number eighteen as our own dear Craig Laughlin did. As _LockerÓ said on the air, _Thereês a lot of goals left in that jersey!Ó Hereês hoping Stephenson gets a chance to pot some. 8. Philipp Grubauer performed with mixed results in the start, and though he gave up three goals, saved at least two or three genuine, honest-to-God breakaways as well. Heês still one of the top ten backup goalies in the NHL, in my personal opinion. 9. The Capitals took entirely too many stick penalties in this game. Would you believe it? Itês hard to win games when youêre playing with one fewer player than your opponent. Each bad poke check, each ill-timed stick lift, is two minutes played at a significant deficit. That matters. 10. The Capitals still sit high atop the Metropolitan Division, and the ass-end of a back-to-back is prime territory for a sneaky whuppinê. Welp, the fourteen game point streak finally came to an end tonight, but the second half of a back-to-back in a logical place to stumble. Next up is the New Jersey Devils on Thursday at Prudential Center.  "

Johnny Gaudreau scored with 31 seconds on the clock in overtime and Calgary edged the Ottawa Senators 3-2, two days after Gulutzan called his struggling squad""pathetic. "" Gulutzan thought his players were in the right frame of mind from the start this time and wasn't worried even when the Senators mounted a late comeback. ""The one thing is, when we get down we're not great at coming back, but when we have the lead in the third we have a great record,"" Gulutzan said. ""I wasn't worried about that, just the feel on the bench was that the guys were dialed in. "" Micheal Ferland and Sean Monahan also scored for the Flames (25-24-3), who squandered a 2-0 lead in the third period but still snapped a four-game losing streak. Brian Elliott, a former goalie for the Senators, made 25 saves in the victory. ""We found a way to win,"" Gaudreau said. ""It was a big one for us. "" Chris Wideman and Tommy Wingels scored for the Senators (26-15-6), and Mike Condon stopped 23 shots. The game marked the return of former Ottawa coach Dave Cameron, who was fired after last season. He is now an assistant with Calgary. Senators coach Guy Boucher thought his team let an opportunity slip away as it failed to have its best effort through the first 40 minutes. ""The reality is, when you're not there for two periods you don't deserve to win and I think the result indicates the game,"" he said. The Senators had spoken about not underestimating the slumping Flames, but Boucher said the letdown didn't come as a huge surprise. ""I think we lacked a bit of respect in terms of the fear factor and we had to battle that,"" Boucher acknowledged. ""Having said that, I think the third period we played a really good period, our guys were bouncing back and it was a great character point. "" With both teams heading into the All-Star break, the win came at a most opportune time for the Flames. ""Anytime you get some time off, you want to be going in thinking about that last game as it sticks with you, so I think that was a big win for our team here,"" Monahan said. After a slow start, the Senators scored twice in the third to draw even and finally give the 16,263 on hand at Canadian Tire Centre something to get excited about. Wideman tied the score 2-all with 62 seconds remaining in regulation when he beat Elliott to the far side. ""We didn't really play the way that we wanted. They did a much better job than we did creating chances and battling for loose pucks,"" Ottawa captain Erik Karlsson said. ""Somehow we found a way in the third period to come back and did a great job at that, but at the end of the day, a full 64 minutes wasn't really good enough to win this game, so that's why we're lucky we came away with a point. "" Wingels, making his Senators debut after being acquired Tuesday from San Jose, tipped Fredrik claesson 's point shot to put Ottawa on the board early in the period. ""It felt good to get one and the team battled hard to get a point, so happy about that,"" Wingels said. Calgary scored first for the first time in 10 games when Ferland connected at 9:39 of the second. The Flames made it 2-0 with under three minutes left in the period as Dougie Hamilton deked his way around Ryan Dzingel to get a shot off. Poor defensive coverage left the puck out front, where Monahan was able to draw it back and put it between his legs to beat Condon. ""I didn't really think about it; it just kind of happened,"" Monahan said. ""It was a big goal there for the turning point in the game and we needed to maintain that lead. We didn't, but we needed to find a way to win and we did that. "" NOTES: Ottawa RW Chris Neil was a healthy scratch. D Mark Borowieckimissed his fifth straight due to the flu. ... Calgary D Jyrki Jokipakka and C Freddie Hamilton were healthy scratches. UP NEXT Flames: Host the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday night. Senators: At the Florida Panthers on Tuesday night.  ",Ross A,Flames complete season sweep over Sens with 3-2 OT win,"The Senators probably shouldêve done better against the faltering Flames, but then again, they probably shouldêve played better to get a better result. They earned a point they probably didnêt deserve in a 3-2 OT loss. The Flames actually came into the game sounding like the Senators of yore. Their stars were struggling, they had lost four in a row, they had let in the first goal of the game nine games in a row, and they featured Brian Elliott, Alex Chiasson, and Dave Cameron. The first period was pretty boring. Ottawa had the better run of play, partially thanks to three powerplays compared to Calgaryês zero, but they couldnêt score mostly due to the philosophy of Too Many Passes. I didnêt count how many good scoring opportunities were passed up for one more pass, but Iêm guessing coach Guy Boucher wouldêve thought it was too many. Iêm sure he would have been calm about it at the intermission, as heês rarely known to lose his temper. Such a happy guy. The second period started with Ottawa still on the powerplay, but as per usual, they couldnêt score. Elliott wasnêt facing a lot of shots, but he comfortably stopped pretty much everything that came his way. Calgary even got a powerplay of their own shortly after, but Ottawa killed it off with no tense moments. It really was shaping up to be a horrifically boring game until newcomer Tommy Wingels blew a tire at the offensive blue line, setting up a two-on-two the other way. What happened next was a complete mystery to me. Micheal Ferland threw a shot on goal that Mike Condon stopped, but instead of covering it, he swept it aside. Even though the Sens outnumbered the Flames four-to-two, the puck ended up right on the stick of Ferland again who tucked it in easily. The Flames would get the next goal of the game too, as some commotion in front led to Condon sprawled on the ice. The Sens had four guys down low, but for some reason none of them decided to hit Sean Monahan, his stick, or the puck. They all just stood around and watched as he put the puck between his legs and roofed it into a gaping cage. Iêve watched the replay many times, and I canêt for the life of me figure out why not a single Senator tried to play the puck. The Sens would go to the powerplay right afterward with a chance to bring it within one entering the second intermission. Of course they wouldnêt score, though a lot of the passing was pretty. Theyêd make their first errant pass just as the penalty expired, which would allow them to spring Kris Versteeg fresh out of the box on a breakaway, but Karlsson skated the fastest Iêve seen him in a long time to take away the chance (sorry for the terrible quality, but itês the only one I could find): The Sens would then just muck around for the last 20 seconds or so of the period, planning to not make anymore mistakes in the second. The second period showed the first instance of line juggling I can remember Boucher doing in a while, trying to find a spark somewhere. It continued into the third, meaning we got to see great combos such as Wingels and Dzingel out there together. Ottawa actually got on the board to start the third period, which was a nice change of pace. It was looking like Fredrik Claessonhad his first NHL goal, but then it turned out Tommy Wingels had tipped it home, earning his first goal as a Senator. The cheer from the crowd was nice after it was announced he had his first goal in his first game after the trade. Ottawa dug for the tying goal, but they couldnêt find it for the longest time. With just six minutes to play, Kyle Turris took a hooking penalty at the Flamesê net, making the comeback look even less likely. On the PK, Zack Smithês stick got chopped in a half on a near-breakaway, but for some reason that wasnêt a penalty. Ottawa would get the better scoring chances over that timeframe, meaning they easily killed off the penalty. And then with a minute left, Chris Wideman unleashed a bullet from the point through a Mark Stone screen and past Brian Elliott. The Flames would then take the chance to much around to end the period, ensuring overtime happened. Ottawa would get most of the puck in OT, but like most of the game, they wouldnêt do anything with the possession. It seemed like every single shift, a Senator would cycle the puck in, pass it to somebody, and then theyêd skate out of the zone and the other Sens would change. This continued for three-and-a-half minutes. Finally, Johnny Gaudreau had enough, and he dove to knock the puck away from Erik Karlsson who was skating out his own zone. The puck went to Mikael Backlund, who then got to skate in on a 2-on-0 with Gaudreau. Condon went down early, and four quick passes gave Gaudreau an easy tap-in for the game-winning goal. Honourable Mention: Fredrik Claesson Absolutely crushed the minutes he played, and almost snagged his first NHL goal. (Too bad we didnêt get to see the celebration he has planned, yet.) Thereês no way Boucher can take him out of the lineup now, is there? Dishonourable Mention: Mike Condon He seemed very lost to me tonight, not tracking the puck well, handling rebounds awkwardly, and generally not helping the team. The poor guy is probably tired and could use the All-Star Break. But tonight, I donêt think he gave his team any help. Sens Zero: Dion Phaneuf I donêt like giving out zeroes, but tonight Phaneuf didnêt impress me at all. He got run over. He looked old and slow. Every shot I saw him take got blocked. The fact that Ceci and Wideman were given the chance to tie the game late (and succeeded) says to me that Boucher saw the same thing. I canêt solely blame him for the loss, but he was the most disappointing performer to me.  ",Matchsticks and Gasoline,"Johnny Gaudreau Scores the Overtime Winner, Calgary Flames Losing Streak is Over","The Flames scored first, Brian Elliott was huge, Sean Monahan scored a beautiful goal, Johnny Gaudreau scored the overtime winner and the Flames snapped a 4 game losing streak with a 3-2 win over the Ottawa Senators. First Period The 3M line was no more. One of the best lines in the NHL all season long, the trio of Matthew Tkachuk, Mikael Backlund and Michael Frolik were split up for this game, in an effort to try and boost the rest of the struggling team. Michael Frolik was moved to play with Johnny Gaudreau and Sean Monahan, while Alex Chiasson (woo....) was moved to play with Tkachuk and Backlund. After trading terrible starts with Chad Johnson to start this road trip, Brian Elliott was back in net for the Flames. Most importantly: could they score first? They almost gave up the first goal midway through the first, as a great pass from Erik Karlsson to Kyle Turris sent him in on a breakaway, but a big save by Elliott kept the score deadlocked at zero. Michael Frolik took a high-sticking double minor with 2:54 left in the first, setting up a huge penalty kill for the Flames with one of their best penalty killers in the box. The Flames would do a solid job on the PK for the first stretch of the penalty and the score would be tied at zero after the first.  The Flames looked like a respectable team and did not concede much, but also did not generate anything too significant either. Baby steps though. Shot attempts were 16-5 for Calgary at even strength. Have to hit the net though, as the shots were 6-6 in the first. Second Period The Flames had a good start to the second in that they completed the kill of the Frolik penalty. After that, it was a pretty quiet period until a beautiful miracle occurred. Matt Stajan dropped a pass to Micheal Ferland who fired a shot and was stopped, but he picked up his rebound and put it past Mike Condon to put the Flames up 1-0 for the first time in 10 games. Not just that, it was apparently their first lead in quite some time. Things got even better! Johnny Gaudreauês pass deflected to Dougie Hamilton who made a power move to the net and was stopped, but a beautiful, between the legs play by Sean Monahan in tight enabled him to flip the puck over Condon for his 16th of the season. Not even just a 1-0 lead, but now a 2-0 lead which is a big deal for this Calgary team. What a goal.  A solid second period, where things actually went the Flames way, led to a 2-0 lead after two periods. They also led the shot clock 16-13. Third Period The Senators would get on the board early in the third, with Tommy Wingels deflecting the puck past Brian Elliott to cut the Calgary lead to one. Something had finally gone wrong for the Flames, so how would they respond?  With a very quiet third period. The Flames played a really solid road game, creating chances, making smart plays and not giving up much at all. Unfortunately they just could not hold on, as the Senators tied the game with 1:02 left in the third period, because that is just how it goes these days. A Chris Wideman shot was blasted past Elliott with the Senators having the extra attacker. They were so close to escaping with a regulation win, but they could not hold on. Off to 3-on-3 with the score tied at 2. Shots were 24-22 for Calgary in regulation. Overtime Brian Elliott was huge in overtime, making 3 game saving stops to keep the Flames in it. The Flames really did not generate much at all in the first four minutes of overtime, but then magic: Johnny Gaudreau forced a Karlsson turnover with a diving play, leading him and Backlund to go in on a 2-on-0, where they passed back and forth a dizzying amount of times before Gaudreau fired the puck into the empty net, busting his goal drought and snapping the Flames losing streak. BIG. Flames 3 Stars Brian Elliott: He saved the game multiple times in overtime and had a number of good saves throughout regulation play. That is the Moose we were promised, please go on a run Moose, please. Johnny Gaudreau: He was buzzing today, it looked like he was going to be stymied again, but he won the game on a terrific play, ending his goal drought. He finished with a goal and an assist. He also controlled 73.9% of shot-attempts at even strength, second only to Sean Monahan. Sean Monahan: Speaking of Monahan, how about that goal. Beautiful. 75% of shot-attempts in his favour. Great game. Notes Michael Frolik has been one of the best Flames all season long, but it would be beneficial if he stopped his recent habit of taking penalties. The Gaudreau-Monahan-Frolik line was dominant at even-strength, so we will likely see this experiment continuing past the all star break. If it continues like it did tonight, that is fine by me. The Mark Giordano-Dougie Hamilton pairing is gold. Not a big fan of Chiasson with Backlund and Tkachuk. He has no finish, I donêt think that the skilled players on the Flames should constantly be saddled with a guy that cannot keep up offensively. I know their right-wing depth is terrible but maybe someone should be called up because Chiasson should be on the fourth line. Why does the Backlund unit never start on powerplays? The Monahan unit has really struggled to generate offense and get on the scoreboard lately, but the Backlund unit creates more opportunities and ends up on the scoresheet more often. This has been going on for awhile but nothing has changed. That game from Brian Elliott was huge. One of the goalies needs to step up, I donêt care who. Hopefully Elliott can leverage this game into going on a run for the team. Next Up Itês the all-star break. Johnny Gaudreau is off to Los Angeles and the rest of the team gets some time to rest. The Flames have played a lot of hockey this season, so a rest should be beneficial. They have to come out hot when they are back. Their next game is Wednesday at home against the Minnesota Wild.  "

In his team's highest-scoring contest of the season, Marchessault delivered late in the third period to lift the Florida Panthers over the Ottawa Senators6-5 on Tuesday night. With the score tied at 4, goalie Mike Condon tried to clear the puck from behind the net but lost control of it. Marchessault grabbed the loose puck and poked it into the open net with 6:03 left to put the Panthers ahead 5-4. ""It just rolled right off his stick,"" Marchessault said. ""It came to me.

"" Florida tied the score at 4 on Matheson's second goal, a long slap shot from the point at 9:53 of the second. Matheson posted the first two-goal game of his NHL career. Ottawa stretched its lead to 4-2 when Karlsson grabbed a rebound near the blue line and fired it past Luongo at 2:19 of the second. The Panthers quickly closed to 4-3 after Sceviour poked in the puck from the left side of the crease 18 seconds later. The goal was the first for Sceviour in 39 games. Luongo took a shot off his mask midway through the second period but stayed in the game. The Senators took a 3-2 lead when Wideman fired a slap shot from high in the right circle that hit the top of the net with 30.6 seconds left in the first. Ottawa tied it at 2 on Dzingel's second goal when he took a rebound off the end boards and tucked it into the net with 11:06 to go in the first.

",Colin4000,"Panthers get by Senators, win 6-5","The Florida Panthers jostled by the Ottawa Senators in yet another high scoring game, taking the regulation victory 6-5.  Florida opened up the scoring three minutes in, with Michael Matheson making a rush to the net and the puck somehow tricking through Condon and the two Sens defensemen. Both teams were giving up chances left and right, but it was Florida who got on the board first The Panthersê lead wouldnêt last long, however, as Ryan Dzingel received a crisp pass from Kyle Turris and fired it past Roberto Luongo. 24 seconds later, notable goal scorer Mark Pysyk would pot one past Condon, restoring the Panthersê lead. With the period halfway through, the scoring kept on flowing. Dzingel would get his second of the game, burying one from the side of the net after a missed shot from the point deflected off the boards. Game tied 10 minutes in, on pace for 25 goals. Period one was a bit scrappy as well with plenty of offsetting minors, creating plenty of 4-on-4 hockey. Chris Wideman took advantage of the extra space, strolling into the middle of the circle and blasting a slapshot past Luongo. The Panthersê defense was way out of position on the play, but it was a wicked shot by Wideman to get him his third goal of the season and his second in consecutive games. Mark Stone also finally got his 100th career assist, after sitting on 99 for the last eight games. Ottawa led by a single goal after one, although the Panthers led in shots 13-11.  The shootout would continue into the second period, as Ottawa and Florida exchanged goals in the first three minutes. An Erik Karlsson slapshot would beat Luongo again, getting his first goal in 21 games (not including his goal at the All-Star Game on Sunday). Colton Sceviouranswered 18 seconds later, making the game 4-3. Neither goalie looked sharp tonight, combining for a .865 Sv%. With Reimer becoming a father earlier in the day, and Andrew Hammond just returning from injury, neither team was keen on make a goaltending change. Seconds away from the game being half over, Matheson got his second goal of the night to tie the game 4-4. The 22-year-old defenseman has been one of the Panthersê bright spots of the season, emerging as a top-4 defender in his rookie season. At this point, five of the eight goals had been scored by defensemen. Later in the frame, both benches would gift each other with too-many-men penalties. Neither team would capitalize, although Luongo saved a grade A chance with Kyle Turris is front. The penalties continued to flow as well, with Dion Phaneuf taking his second minor penalty, and both teams combining for 30 penalty minutes (all in minors). Incredible how all eight goals so far were at even strength. Florida ended the second period leading in shots 26-24. A complete juxtaposition to the first 40 minutes, both teams decided to finally flip the defensive switch in the period three. By the frameês halfway mark, both teams combined for only seven shots, and not a single penalty was taken. Then with six minutes left, this happened...  A gaffe by Mike Condon behind the net gave Jonathan Marchessault his 15th goal of the season, and the Panthers the go-ahead goal. Ottawa challenged the play for offside, although the goal stood. Condon would be pulled in the final minute with the Sens trailing by one, although Jason Demers would add the empty-netter. What was once a 4-2 lead turned into being down 6-4. Derick Brassard scored with 11 seconds left, although it was all for nothing as the Panthers defeated the Sens by the final score of 6-5. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson Although the Sens couldêve potentially forced OT had the empty net goal not bounced over his stick, Karlsson had one heck of a night. He finished the night with a goal and an assist, and created plenty of offensive chances for the Sens. His eight shots on goal were more than anyone on either team. Honourable Mention: The fourth line In their first game in a while without Lazar, the fourth line had a Corsi differential of +5, and each player finished with a 5v5 CF% above 63%. Kudos for not getting caved in. Sens Zero: Mike Condon Gaffe aside, Condon finished the game with a .815 5v5 Sv%. This is his fourth game of the month with at least four goals allowed, and it appears that the 25 consecutive games played is wearing him down. Now that Hammondês back from injury, it may be time to end Condonês streak. Sens Killer: Michael Matheson With two goals on the night and seven shots on goal, Matheson was a force to be reckoned with for the Senators. He was also the only Panthers player with multiple blocked shots.  ",Litter Box Cats,Panthers show moxie in wild 6-5 win over Senators,"The Florida Panthers kicked off the NHLês unofficial second half of the season with a wild 6-5 win over the Ottawa Senators Tuesday night at BB&T Center. Jonathan Marchessault scored the go-ahead goal with 6:03 left in regulation to snap a 4-4 tie and Jason Demers added an empty-netter with 35 seconds left to offset an even later Derick Brassard tally. A wide-open first period saw the two teams combine for five goals to set the tone for the rest of the evening. Michael Matheson opened the scoring 2:24 into the action, with the assists going to Alex Petrovic and Nick Bjugstad. After passing the puck off the boards to himself, Matheson drove to the net and Mike Condon stopped his shot, but the puck found itês way over the goal line after deflecting off the skate of Dennis Wideman. The Senators countered at the 4:59 mark when a streaking Ryan Dzingel beat Roberto Luongo top shelf after taking a pretty centering pass from Kyle Turris. The Panthers responded with a nifty passing play of the own 23 seconds later. Mark Pysyk tipped in Derek MacKenzieês perfect goalmouth feed after the veteran pivot took a pass from Michael Sgarbossa. Dzingel cashed in for his second of the night when Matheson lost track of him near the post, leading to a very easy Ottawa goal. Assists on the play went to Marc Methot and Bobby Ryan. After taking a pass from Erik Karlsson, a wide-open Wideman gave the Senators the lead when he blasted the puck by Luongo with 31 seconds left in the period. Mark Stone was credited with the second helper, which his 100th career assist.  Karlsson would notch a goal of his own 2:19 into second period. The slick defenseman one-timed the rebound of Tom Pyattês shot, which struck teammate Zack Smith who was screening in front, and came back to the Swede at the point. Colton Sceviour started the Cats comeback when backhanded the carom of Demersê dump pass off the backboards past Condon 18 seconds later. Greg McKegg drew the second assist on Sceviorês sixth goal, which ended a 39-game drought. The Panthers tied things up at the 9:53 mark when Sgarbossa won a faceoff back to Matheson and the rookie pounded the puck by Condon for the first multi-goal game of his burgeoning career. Marchessault struck the key blow when he stole Condonês mishandle behind the net and tapped the puck into the yawning net for his fifteenth goal. The win was the Panthers second in a row, and coupled with a Philadelphiaês loss to Carolina, back them just two points out of the second wild card. Florida will be looking for two more points when the Anaheim Ducks come calling on Friday. Law & Order Not the best of starts for Roberto Luongo, but the veteran keeper came up big in the final frame, where he made 16 of his 36 saves to earn career win number 450. Luongo is one of five goalies to reach that plateau. Jonathan Marchessaultês go-ahead goal extended his points streak to five games. Marchessault scored the winner in Floridaês last game before the All-Star brak versus Tampa Bay. All eleven goals came with the teams at even strength. Florida went 0-for-3 on the power play while Ottawa went 0-for-4. Nick Bjugstadês first period assist ended a run of eight games without a point dating back to December 20. Erik Karlsson led all skaters with eight shots on goal and logged a game-high 27:29 of ice time. With two helpers, Michael Sgarbossa posted the first multi-point game of his NHL career. A rare night with no points for Vincent Trocheck, but the red-hot center won 18 of 27 draws, had two shots on goal, a block, two hits and finished with a +1 rating. Silver Seven has the other side of last nightês high-scoring affair. The two teams meet again and I do know where and I do know when, February 26, back in sunny Sunrise.  "

He led the Lightning to the Eastern Conference final in 2011. ""He wanted this one pretty bad,"" Ottawa left wing Mike Hoffman said. ""I'm sure he's feeling pretty happy about it,"" Stone added.

",Callum Fraser,Senators Bounce Back with 5-2 Win Against Bolts,"Winless post All-Star Game - albeit only one game played - the Senators were looking to start a new streak. A mediocre 1-1-2 in their previous four games, the team hadnêt looked like the solid, structured, tight-knit group that made their way through Deathcember and a difficult January schedule with ease.  February brought with it a new string of opponents. 12 of the Senatorsê next 13 matchups were against non-playoff teams. The only question was had the team prepared properly for the month.  For a while now, the Senators have had no problem getting up for the big games, the rivalries and the must-win situations. But itês been an entirely different story with the lay-ups, so to speak. For whatever reason, Ottawa has made it harder on themselves in matchups against bottom-half teams by failing to bring with them a high compete level and attention to detail. Plain and simple, sometimes they just look flat-out uninterested. There were many burning questions going into Thursday nightês contest. Would Condon rebound after a beatdown in Sunrise? How would Curtis Lazar and Mark Borowiecki fare in their first game back from being healthy scratches?  But the biggest one was more of an overall look. Could the Senators play against the Lightning the way theyêve played against the Canadiens, Capitals and Blue Jackets (amongst others)? The first period began with a good push from the away team. At one point, Ottawa led 5-0 in the shot category.  Ryan Dzingel rang one off the post, the Senatorsê penalty kill, which had turned away 12 straight, was perfect again after Derick Brassard went off for holding, and Mike Condon made a solid save in tight.  No goals to report, but a rather decent 20 minutes from Ottawa, who led in shots 7-5 at the buzzer. The second frame would prove to be much more entertaining. Seconds in, it was nearly deja vu for Condon as he misplayed the puck behind the net and lost it to a Lightning forward. But this time, he would recover, kicking out the puck on the goal line after it had taken a deflection off Brassardês skate. He couldnêt keep the next scoring chance out, though. Lazar was pickpocketed in his own end, which resulted in Tyler Johnson scoring his 16th of the year past a sprawling Condon.  But as they did in Sunrise, when the Senators got down, they quickly got it right back. Just as TSN play-by-play commentator Chris Cuthbert was bringing up Zack Smithês four-game point streak, the 28-year-old made it five. Behind the net, Smith found Mark Stone, who was busting in from the blue line. Stoneês 17th (tied for the team lead with Mike Hoffman and Kyle Turris) knotted this one at one. Stone wouldnêt be tied with Turris long. On a nothing play, Erik Karlsson was rather dangerously taken down by Braydon Coburn away from the puck, giving the Senators their second power play of the night. Karlsson would feed Turris with some free ice in front of him and the 27-year-old would bury it past Andrei Vasilevskiy. A few minutes later, Ottawa would find themselves on the man advantage again, and after Vasilevskiy stopped Turris in tight, Karlsson rang one off the crossbar. It felt like the fifth one the captain had dented in the past few weeks. At the other end, Condon was solid. Making his franchise record 26th consecutive start, he fought back after allowing the first goal with a couple impressive saves off a deflection from the point and one-timer on the penalty kill. Ottawa would end the period leading 20-14 in shots. Turris would soon have company once again at the top of the team lead in goals. (Thereês another one of these coming, by the way) On another power play, Stone stripped the puck - drink - from a Lightning forward and busted up the middle. He would drop it back to Turris, who found Hoffman waiting at the point ready to rip home his 18th of the year.   Hoffman had been trending up, as of late. After the Lightning would get within one off a beautiful tip by Brayden Point, the Senators would extend their lead once more. Stone mustêve felt left out of all the fun, so he decided to again join Turris and Hoffman at the top.  Erik Karlsson fired a shot wide of the net, but Stone perfectly redirected it past the glove of Vasilevskiy for his 18th of the year. A nice way to end a solid team performance, Chris Kelly fired home his fourth of the year into the empty net in his 800th career game. Now, donêt we all feel better after that? Sens Hero: Special Teams The Senators went 2-for-5 on the power play and 3-for-3 on the penalty kill. In all honesty, theyêve couldêve popped a couple more on the man advantage with the chances they generated, but all around a great display from their top-10 PK and up-and-down PP. Sens Hero: Mark Stone Has anyone heard a peep from the mainstream media about Stone for Selke? Anyone? Yeah, me neither. Itês a damn shame, too, because the 2016-17 campaign is turning into maybe Stoneês best yet. By far the most consistent on the team and maybe the best overall two-way player, Stone has the resume for the trophy, but it all depends on if heês going to get the recognition. Sens Hero: Kyle Turris Speaking of consistency. The Senators are worlds better with Turris in the lineup, thatês no secret, but itês proving to be nearly black and white with the teamês No. 1 centre back after he missed a third of last season with a leg injury. With 18 goals on the year, Turris is on pace for a new career high. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson It was a fun night. Hereês a recap of Karlssonês play.  ",Raw Charge,"Sens smother Lightning, 5-2","The Ottawa Senators beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 5-2 at Amalie Arena in Tampa Thursday night. _Thatês back-to-back disappointing losses for us. There isnêt any panic in our room, but itês time to bear down and start picking up points every night again.Ó - Ottawa Senators defenseman Chris Wideman, after Tuesdayês loss to the Florida Panthers That was the mindset of the Senators, a team almost certainly destined for the postseason at this point. They held onto this thought coming into tonightês game against the Lightning, a team trying to find their bearings after the All-Star break, bearings they struggled to find at all during the first half of the season. As such, the Lightning are watching their postseason hopes fade as the regular season dwindles to the final 30 games. Tonight, a defensive first period yielded no score with Ottawa outshooting Tampa Bay 7-5. The Senators registered the first five shots of the game with the Lightning not getting their first until the 8:39 mark.  The Lightning actually took the initial lead when Tyler Johnson scored a second-effort goal at 3:39, getting an assist from Nikita Kucherov. That goal seemed to ignite the Senators and they responded with an intense offensive surge. The pressure paid off at 6:33 when Mark Stone tied the game, with assists going to Zack Smith and Cody Ceci. They took the lead at 11:03 on a power play goal by Kyle Turris, a shot that Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy got a glove on but couldnêt grab. Mike Hoffman and Erik Karlsson picked up assists on the play. The Senators carried the 2-1 lead into the third period. They increased their lead on another power play goal, this one coming from Hoffman, assisted by Turris and Stone at 2:53. The Lightning drew within one at 7:46, thanks to Brayden Point scoring with helpers coming from Brian Boyle and Ondrej Palat. Less than two minutes later, Ottawa stretched the lead back to two on a goal from Stone, who was assisted by Karlsson and Derick Brassard. Chris Kelly capped the scoring, thanks to an assist from Karlsson, on an empty net goal with 24.4 remaining, making the final score 5-2. The loss, their sixth in the last seven games (two of them coming in overtime), drops the Lightning to 22-24-6 (12-10-2 at home) and still eight points (at press time) out of a playoff spot with just 30 games remaining on the regular season schedule. The Lightningês current homestand continues Saturday when they host the pacific-leading Anaheim Ducks.  "

Lehner made 37 saves, Kyle Okposo scored his 16th goal and the Buffalo Sabres beat the Ottawa Senators 4-0 on Saturday night to snap a three-game skid. Lehner got his fourth career shutout. His first two came with the Senators, who traded him to Buffalo before last season. ""They are a smart team out there. Obviously, playing with them a little bit, I know their tendencies and where they are going to go,"" Lehner said. ""I do a lot of pre-scout, a lot of thinking out there. That's a big part of my game, to try and see what's going to happen."" In five games against the Senators over the past two seasons, Lehner is 3-0-2 with a .961 save percentage and a 1.18 goals-against average. The Sabres also got goals from Ryan O'Reilly, Sam Reinhart and Marcus Foligno. Jack Eichel had two assists. ""It's a big win, but the big piece is Lenny there,"" O'Reilly said. Buffalo is 5-0-1 in its last six home games and has earned a point in seven straight games against Ottawa. The Senators closed out a three-game road trip with their fourth loss in six games. ""They outplayed us for most of the game and we didn't deserve it,"" forward Zack Smith said. ""We threw a lot of pucks at the net, but I don't think we were there enough."" Mike Condon allowed four goals on 25 shots before getting pulled in the third period. Condon was making his 18th straight start, and coach Guy Boucher said he took him out to get backup Andrew Hammond some playing time, not because he was displeased with condon 's performance. Okposo gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead with 9:49 left in the first period. He received a pass from Justin Falk in the left corner, held off defenseman Marc Methot as he skated to the left slot and flipped a backhand into the far corner. O'Reilly scored his 10th to make it 2-0 with 3:09 remaining in the second. Stationed in the right slot, O'Reilly redirected Rasmus Ristolainen's wrist shot from the point past Condon. Lehner made 13 saves in the second period. His best stop came in the final minute when he skated out of the crease and reached back to glove a hard wrist shot by Mike Hoffman. Reinhart knocked in the rebound of his own missed shot 5:53 into the third period for his 11th goal of the season. Foligno slid a wrist shot under condon 's pads with 9:09 remaining after Eichel intercepted Dion phaneuf 's clearing pass. Eichel also assisted on Reinhart's goal. Lehner had 16 saves in the third period, including five on a Senators' power play. ""He played phenomenal tonight,"" O'Reilly said. ""All year, he's been one of the most consistent players.""

",nkb,Sabres Dump Sens 4-0,"Sometimes, when itês not your night, itês just not your night. The Ottawa Senators entered tonightês tilt against the Buffalo Sabres coming off a strong performance against the Tampa Bay Lightning and with their eyes set on the Montreal Canadiens at the top of the division. By the time the game was over, there were a lot more questions than answers to be found.  Itês not that Ottawa played a terrible game per se, the 4-0 score line certainly flattered the Sabres, but they werenêt as sharp as on Thursday night; youêd be hard pressed to name a single player who had a good game. The first period started well enough for the Sens, with sustained pressure on the opening shit from the Derick Brassard, Zack Smith and Mark Stone lines. Guy Boucher has been starting periods with the trio for the past couple of weeks in lieu of the Pageau group, and though itês a small thing itês a good thing. However, after that initial burst Buffalo had the better of the play for the most of the rest of the period. Jack Eichelês line, and Eichel himself in the particular, were especially dangerous for the Sabres. Maybe itês because he missed the start of this year owing to injury, but Eichel has been the forgotten man amidst the endless Auston Matthews and Connor McDavid hype. Tonight was a reminder that, yes, Jack Eichel is very, very good. Midway through the first, Kyle Okposo would pot his 16th of the season on a sensational individual effort. Marc Methot was no match for Okposo coming off the sideboards and no other Senator could help before Okposo was able to walk in and bury a backhand over Mike Condon. After that, besides a failed powerplay at the end of the frame there were few chances either way. The shots were 10-8 Sabres in all situations; shot attempts where 15-14 in favour of Buffalo at 5v5.  At the start of the second period, Greg Millen remarked that he expected Guy Boucher would have given his team a tongue lashing in the hopes of motivating them. Whether or not Boucher lit into his team isnêt known, but he did open the frame by jumbling his lines. Most notably, Tommy Wingels spent most of the first part of the frame alongside Brassard and Stone. Though it didnêt produce the goal they were looking for, Ottawa was clearly the better team; Buffalo rarely exited their own end for an almost five minute stretch. As it so often goes though, when the Sens were unable to capitalize on their pressure it was the Sabres who found the net and extended their lead. Ryan OêReilly tipped a Ristolainen wrister past a helpless Mike Condon. There was a lot of game to play, but after Robin Lehner robbed Mike Hoffman late in the period on a 2-on-1 break the Sens never really pressed again.  The third period saw the Sabres put two more shots past Condon for a 4-0 lead they would hold on to until the final buzzer. The only intrigue then was Boucherês choice to pull Condon after the fourth goal, meaning Andrew Hammond saw his first action in months. As Condon has flagged fairly dramatically in the last three weeks, the question of when Hammond might draw on has become ever pressing. Craig Anderson is supposedly still a couple of weeks away; if this game is remembered for anything, it might for ending Condonês run of consecutive appearances. Honourable Mention: No heroes tonight, but I thought Brassard deserves some praise for his play in tonightês game. Sens Killer: Jack Eichel had two assists and created several more dangerous chances throughout the night. He was the player on the ice for either team by a wide margin. Sens Killer: Robin Lehner was the busier of the goalies tonight, and when called upon he was equal to the task. His glove save on Mike Hoffman to preserve a two goal lead late in the second was a crucial moment in deciding this game.  ",Die By the Blade,Sabres smother Ottawa in 4-0 win,"The game wasnêt perfect, but for the Buffalo Sabres, the final score certainly was. Robin Lehner made 37 saves for his first shutout of the season as the Buffalo Sabres downed the Ottawa Senators by a final score of 4-0. Lehner was strong throughout the night, including making 16 saves in the third period, en route to his long awaited shutout. Over his last two games, Lehner has made 79 saves on 81 shots, and made a number of _Grade A saves,Ó tonight, according to the returning Jake McCabe.  Tonight wasnêt only a night to celebrate Lehner, however, tonight was a night where all the Sabres big guns came to play. The Sabres got goals from Okposo, OêReilly, Reinhart, and Foligno, while Jack Eichel notched two assists.  Okposoês opening goal was a thing of beauty, a one-man effort that saw him snake the puck through a few players down low and roof a backhand over Mike Condonês shoulder to give the Sabres the lead, which they would not relinquish all night. What a refreshing change. While the team overall played very well tonight, the Eichel line in particular was buzzing all game long. #15 himself was a monster for much of the game, dominating the puck and creating chance after chance.  The victory ended Buffaloês mini-slump and gave them their first victory in three games. Huzzah! Three Questions 1. How will Justin Bailey look, and will he get time with the top lines? Bailey did not get much ice time tonight, finishing with the second-lowest TOI with just 9:24. He did have a few moments of speed and skill, but Iêd like to see him get more time with better players next time around. 2. How will the defense play with this dramatic change in personnel? You canêt ever say the defense played poorly in a shutout. Ristolainen, Falk, and Gorges all notched assists, and believe it or not, Kulikov lead the team in ice time, not Ristolainen.  3. How fashionable are these new goalie pants? Lehner has never not recorded a shutout under the new mandatory goalie pants rule. I expect this streak to continue forever.  "

Allen made 30 saves, Vladimir Tarasenko scored twice and St. Louis beat the Ottawa Senators 6-0 on Tuesday night. Magnus Paajarvi, Patrik Berglund, Alexander Steen and Ivan Barbashev also scored for the Blues (27-22-5), who have won three of four. Paul Stastny and David Perron added two assists apiece. St. Louis shut out Philadelphia 2-0 on Monday night behind Carter Hutton's 26 saves, but Yeo opted for Allen against the Senators and he responded with his second shutout of the season. ""What I've done in the past, what the organization has done in the past, is after a shutout you come back with that same goaltender, but given the way that Jake has played lately we had confidence in him coming into this game,"" Yeo said. ""We knew it was going to be a good test and he would be tested and he was outstanding. "" Ottawa goaltender Andrew Hammond had 24 saves in his first start since Dec. 18. He had been sidelined by a high ankle sprain. The Senators (27-18-6) were coming off a 4-0 loss at Buffalo on Saturday night. They dropped to 1-3-1 in their last five games. Senators coach Guy Boucher made each of his players sit in the locker room and answer questions from the media after the lopsided loss to the Blues. ""We didn't look good and we didn't do collectively what we normally do consistently,"" Boucher said. ""This was about facing the music together. We win as a team and we lose as a team. The coaching staff is there, also, ready to face the music and the players also. ""When you get adversity it builds you or destroys you and I always choose the building part and I think the players sticking together is the first part of the building. "" Hammond started in place of Mike Condon, who got the night off after making 27 consecutive appearances. Much of the crowd headed for the exits after St. Louis made it 4-0 midway through the third on Steen's 11th of the season off his own rebound after a Mike Hoffman giveaway. Minutes later Tarasenko scored his second and Barbashev made it 6-0 on yet another giveaway. ""Generally when we lose I think we come in and we can honestly say it wasn't for a lack of effort, tonight is the exception in that regard,"" Ottawa's Bobby Ryan said. ""We were stale, flat, whatever word you want to use for it. We didn't have the jump early. "" St. Louis jumped in front with two goals in the second. Paajarvi beat Hammond for his second of the season at 1:51, and Tarasenko used a great pass from Paul Stastny to make it 2-0 at 6:46. Berglund jumped on a rebound for an early power-play goal in the third. The Senators challenged the play, arguing the Blues were offside, but the review was inconclusive. Hammond was tested in the opening minutes of the game and made a couple of good saves on Jori Lehtera and Kenny Agostino. NOTES: St. Louis has won five of its last seven road games after winning just five of its first 17. ... Ottawa C Curtis Lazar was a healthy scratch for the second time in four games.

Senators: Continue a four-game homestand Thursday night against Dallas.  ",Beata Elliott,Sens Get Blown Out 6-0 by Blues,"Well, that was just sad. Tonightês tilt between the Ottawa Senators and the St. Louis Blues was both boring and pathetic. It was a game in which the Sens either decided to take the day off, or simply forgot how to hockey. Maybe both. I donêt even know why Iêm bothering to write a full recap tonight when the Sens couldnêt be bothered to play a full game of halfway decent hockey. I should have just inserted a poo emoji and called it a day. That would have summed up this game accurately enough. Letês just say it was bad. So if you sat through all sixty painful minutes of that pathetic excuse for a sports contest, give yourself a pat on the back. You were clearly more emotionally invested in this game than the players were. If you drove out to Kanata in the snow tonight, all I can say to you is that Iêm sorry. You deserved better. And if you didnêt watch the Sens tonight, congratulations on making healthy life choices. I donêt know why you want to know what happened while you were off doing something productive with your life, but just in case, let me explain it to you. The first period began with an exciting sequence courtesy of Mike Hoffman, who Guy Boucher finally decided to play on the first line with Brassard and Stone, after burying him on the Pageau line for most of the season. Hoffman is good enough that he can play with just about anyone, but putting him with Ottawaês best forward is a good way to jumpstart the offense by creating a definitive first line. While the change didnêt result in any goals for the Senators (obviously), I can definitively say that the trio didnêt look terrible throughout the game. St. Louis quickly countered the Senatorsê offense with a number of good chances against Andrew Hammond. In his first game back from injury, the Hamburglar stood tall to keep the score even at 0 despite facing 10 shots in the first frame. He also managed not to get injured, which I guess is a pretty big accomplishment for him at this point. The second period was decidedly, mind-numbingly uneventful, at least on Ottawaês side of things. St. Louis scored an early goal, when Magnus Paajarvi caught Zack Smith attempting to skate backwards to cover for Marc Methot. It was a generally lackadaisical sequence by the Senators, which would end up setting the tone for the rest of the game. With Methot off for hooking, Ottawa was caught running around in their own zone on the penalty kill, resulting in a goal for Vladimir Tarasenko. Itês hard to place the blame on Hammond for not stopping that shot, as Iêll bet even Erik Condra could have scored if given that much time and space. The only other significant event of the second period was an Ottawa chance that was shut down by an early whistle. And not even the kind of early whistle weêre used to. No, this time the puck was way out in the open, untouched by any of players on the ice, clearly visible to all except, apparently, the referee. Not that it made a huge difference in the long run. At least it wasnêt against the Habs in the playoffs this time. A few minutes into the third, St. Louis scored again to go ahead 3-0. Boucher challenged the goal, which looked offside, but the refs deemed it inconclusive, and so the goal stood.  Then a whole lot of nothing happened. The Sens looked bad. Lifeless. Pathetic even. It seemed they would never score again. They still might not. A pass destined for Phaneuf was picked up by a Blues player, who easily walked around Hoffman for a goal that Hammond probably should have had. Then the Blues scored two more ugly goals, one of which was a first NHL goal, because Sens.  Finally, the buzzer sounded and everyone was able to move on with their lives. Except me. I had to relive the game by writing up this recap. Sens Hero: The Fans Yes, you. The person who had to put up with this. YOU are the real hero of this game. The only hero. Honourable Mention: Mike Hoffman He was okay. Better than the rest of his team, at least. Honourable Mention: Kyle Turris When is Turris not good? He is the most consistent, reliable player alive. Sens Zero: Marc Methot A bad penalty and a role in the first goal against makes him our Zero for the day.  Sens Zero: Andrew Hammond The Hamburglar definitely doesnêt deserve all the blame for this loss, but he could have been a lot better. Thereês a good chance he never plays another game for the Sens after this.  ",St. Louis Game Time,Blues Grill Hamburglar on The Road,"Let's face it, the Blues first period last night was lackluster. That's probably being too nice. Tonight however, was totally a different story. Now the Blues didn't score in the first but they sure did get some pressure on Senators starter Andrew Hammond. Not only did the Blues come out firing tonight, Jake Allen looked strong early on. The Blues had 13 shots on goal in the first period. The Blues got the first goal of the night thanks to their most recent call up. Captain Umlaut himself, Magnus Paajarvi makes it 1-0 on an incredible individual move to the front of the net. To which he roofed the puck past Hammond. 56 played like he didn't want to make the trip back to Chicago tonight. The Blues second goal of the night came from the newly formed duo of Paul Stastny and Vladimir Tarasenko. Also, can't forget to mention the keep in by David Perron that kept this play alive. Stastny went to the front of the net and fed a wide open Tarasenko who wasn't going to miss from that spot on the ice. Tarasenko gets his 24th of the season and the Blues get a 2-0 lead. Fast forward to the third period, with the Blues on the powerplay to start things out. Patrik Berglund made it 3-0 on a rebound chance. Kenny Agostino, who had another great night, shoots the puck on net. Berglund doesn't miss a wide open net for his 13th goal of the year. The Blues were just getting this goal scoring party going. Alexander Steen gets his 11th goal of the year, by not giving up on the play. A lot of credit on this also goes to Paul Stastny on the great play and pass to Steen. Stastny could have shot the puck himself but with some patience got it over to Steen who finished it up. 4-0 Blues. Tarasenko nets his 25th goal of the year and gives the Blues a 5-0 lead. Talk about not sitting back in the third period. It was confusing as to which team actually played a game last night. It certainly didn't look like St. Louis. As if their wasn't enough icing on this victory cake, Ivan Barbashev scored his first NHL goal. Not sure what 57 in red was doing in front of the net, but it sure as hell wasn't playing defense. Barashev picks up the loose puck and fires it in the back of the net and the SIX nothing Blues lead. The Blues go on to shutout the Senators 6-0 and give Coach Yeo his third win behind the bench as head coach. This team has done a complete 180 as far as demeanor goes. It's also amazing what your best center can do with arguably (or not) the best two wingers on the team. Too bad Hitch couldn't figure that out, he'd probably still have his job. In any event the Blues are off until Thursday. Player of the Game: Jake Allen. Stopped all 30 shots he faced. And everyone who let me know what the hell Poutine is.  "

He led by example in the Ottawa Senators' 3-2 win over the Dallas Stars on Thursday night. Phaneuf was a force as he scored the opening goal, fought with Stars captain Jamie Benn and seemed determined to get the Senators back on track. ""He really set the tone for a character game,"" Senators coach Guy Bouchersaid. ""I think he was the big leader. "" Phaneuf was celebrating the anniversary of his trade from the Toronto Maple Leafs to the Senators one year ago and the significance clearly wasn't lost on the 31-year-old defenseman. ""The bottom line is there's a relief that we continued to stick with (the game plan) and we found a way to win,"" Phaneuf said. ""We did not feel very good about ourselves after the last game, that goes without saying, and we found a way to respond. We did a great job. Every guy through and through. "" Mark Stone and Chris Kelly also scored for the Senators, and Mike Condonmade 31 saves. Antoine Roussel and Benn scored for the Stars, who are on a four-game losing streak. Kari Lehtonen made 24 saves. The Stars were visibly deflated by the loss, especially considering Jiri Hudlerscored into his own net in the first period to give Ottawa a 2-0 lead. ""I think we've picked almost every way of losing so far, including shooting one on your own net,"" Stars coach Lindy Ruff said. ""It is frustrating. We battled hard in the second, but at the end, we just couldn't quite push through. "" With the game tied at 2, Stone scored his team-leading 19th goal at the six-minute mark of the third when he grabbed the puck behind the net and beat Lehtonen on the wraparound in front of 17,676 at Canadian Tire Centre. ""It was a huge win,"" Stone said. ""Maybe not our best game we've played all year, but able to find a way and that's what good teams do. "" Dallas fell behind 2-0 in the first period, but Roussel got the Stars in the game midway through the second period when he took a pass from Radek Faksa for the easy tap-in from the side of the net. Benn tied it with under four minutes remaining in the period as he was able to get a shot through traffic from just inside the blue line. ""We're a proud team, we play with speed, character and we try to show it every night,"" Roussel said. ""Meanwhile, it doesn't work our way every time and it just seems to be like that lately. "" Despite being outshot 12-6 the Senators held a 2-0 lead after 20 minutes. Phaneuf scored short-handed to open the scoring at the 14-minute mark. Kelly got credit for the second goal after the Stars' Jiri Hudler put the puck in his own net during a delayed penalty call as defensemen Dan Hamhuis and John Klingberg watched helplessly, unable to get to the puck. ""I remember kind of touching the puck before I went off and then went off and saw we had a penalty,"" Kelly said,""and I remember the player throwing it back and I thought the defenseman was going to get it and he quickly realized it was just out of his reach. "" NOTES: Senators C Curtis Lazar and RW Chris Neil were healthy scratches. ... Thursday's game marked the one-year anniversary of Phaneuf being traded from Toronto to Ottawa. ... Stars D Julius Honka and LW Curtis McKenzie were healthy scratches. Former Senators C Jason Spezza (upper body) and Ales Hemsky (hip) were also unavailable for the Stars. UP NEXT Stars: host Carolina on Saturday. Senators: host New York Islanders on Saturday.  ",Colin4000,"Stone leads Sens past Stars, win 3-2","The Ottawa Senators came into this evening looking to snap their two game losing streak, both in which they were shutout. Tonightês challenger, the Dallas Stars, have also been struggling recently coming into the game having lost their last three. With Dallas fighting for a playoff spot and many teams in the Atlantic starting to creep up on Ottawa, both teams really needed a win. The effort on the ice, however, was a different story. In the first period, the play was sloppy at both ends, with turnovers and broken plays happening left and right. Ottawa opened the scoring on the penalty kill, with Cody Ceci off for hooking. Dion Phaneuftook a shot from the point which floated right past Stars goalie Kari Lehtonen, who has continued to struggle for Dallas this season. Ottawa would take the 1-0 lead off their 5th shorthanded goal of the season. Phaneuf would drop the gloves a few minutes later with Jamie Benn, making it quite the eventful one-year anniversary of being traded to Ottawa. What happened soon after was... well... just watch.  After Zack Smith took a delayed penalty, Lehtonen rushed to the net to get Dallas the extra attacker. Jiri Hudler, who was playing in his 700th career game, attempted to pass the puck back to his goalie. Except the goalie was invisible (pulled), which I canêt really blame Hudler for considering Lehtonenês .902 SV%.  The own goal was credited to Chris Kelly, who was the most recent player to score for the Sens coming into this game (also on an empty net). I should mention that Kari Lehtonen wasnêt actually terrible this game. Although the Phaneuf goal was a soft one, he made many stops later in close that couldêve resulted in more goals for Ottawa. The Senators ended the first period with only two shots on goal at 5v5. Yet, they found themselves up 2-0 on home ice. Period two continued the same as period one, with both teams struggling to play a structured game. Ottawa opted to play a more physical style, finishing the game with 26 hits compared to Dallasê 11.  Speaking of physical, the league leader in penalty minutes, Antoine Roussel, scored for Dallas to cut Ottawaês lead in half. On a bit of a defensive breakdown, Roussel was waiting on the doorstep while a lost Erik Karlsson scurried to cover him. Dallas started to take over later in the period, leading to a Jamie Benn goal that drifted untouched through a dozen bodies and into the back of the net. Condon moved to anticipate a tip, although the puck had other plans, beaming right to the top shelf. Like magic, the Senatorsê two-goal lead vanished into thin air.  Period number three was a lot less jumbled than the previous two. Passes were being completed, teams were getting extended zone time, and the defense was a lot tighter. Mark Stone broke the tie six minutes into the third period, breaking the Sensê 176 minutes and 41 seconds since the last time they scored a goal at 5v5 (the last one also happened to be scored by Stone). A Cody Ceci shot from the point hit the side of the net, which was quickly swooped up by Stone for the wraparound.  Dallas would put the jets on late in the game to try to force OT, including a two-man advantage in the dying seconds. However, Mike Condon and Ottawaês defense stayed rock solid, holding on to take the victory by a final score of 3-2.  Sens Hero: Mark Stone Stone continued to be the driver of Ottawaês offense, making nifty plays and scoring the game-winning goal. He didnêt have any takeaways tonight, but was dangerous in all other aspects. Honourable Mention: Mike Condon Stopped 31 of 33 shots, looked solid after finally resting for a game. Definitely something this team has lacked in the last couple weeks. Honourable Mention: Jiri Hudler Jiri Hudler has scored more goals for the Ottawa Senators than Curtis Lazar this season.   Couldnêt have said it better myself. Sens Zero: Hoffman-Pageau-Pyatt Itês never easy to be deployed against top competition, especially when it includes Tyler Seguin, Jamie Benn and John Klingberg. Ottawaês trio was completely overwhelmed with the tough assignment tonight, finishing a negative-eight in shot attempt differential.   ",Defending Big D,Starsing: When Losing Just Isnêt Enough,"I havenêt quite reached the point where I can laugh at the comedy of errors that this season has turned into for the Dallas Stars. In fact, I still get frustrated watching games like tonight.  Dallas has talent. They just canêt seem to put anything sustainable together this season. And thatês probably why itês so frustrating for Stars fans   weêve seen what this team can do with quite a bit of the talent on this roster from last season, and at this point in the year, when wins are so desperately needed, and the same defensive issues seem to give away the points, itês hard to find positives. Hereês one: Dallas didnêt allow a goal on the penalty kill. But damn if they didnêt give them up in the most heartbreaking of ways anyway... First Period Dallas lead in puck possession for the first half of the period, taking advantage of several turnovers by the Senators in their own zone. Unfortunately, possession doesnêt mean much other than a morality boost if goals arenêt scored because of it. The Stars didnêt do any scoring even thought at one point they led in shots on goal 10-2 over Ottawa. As Stars games often do, the team dominating the period would go into the break down by two goals. The first goal was a shorthanded goal off of a faceoff in the Starsê zone. The goal was made possible by Kari Lehtonenês decision to handle the puck behind his own net, sending the puck straight into the skate of an official. The bounce off of the skate would lead to several shorthanded chances that Lehtonen was able to shut down.  However, the ensuing faceoff would lead to a seeing-eye shot that Lehtonen never saw due to the traffic in front of him. After that goal, the wind kind of came out of Dallasê sails. Captain Jamie Benn, looking to give his team some momentum back, dropped gloves against his old nemesis Dion Phaneuf. It was a lot more like some shoving and upper body strength testing than a true fight, but Benn was effective in sending a message to his team. Or so they thought. Instead, in true Dallas Stars 2016-2017 fashion, theyêd manage to allow another goal against in the most ridiculous manner possible. On a delayed penalty, with Lehtonen pulled for an extra attacker, Jiri Hudler would make a drop pass....that would split right between Dan Hamhuisand John Klingberg for an own goal against. It counts when you score into your own net in that situation, as the other team never had possession of the puck for the whistle to blow the play dead. And like that, Dallas was losing in typical Dallas fashion. Second Period The Stars demonstrated some good patience in the second frame, coming out much the same way as they did to start the game. They started to get more pucks to the front of the net, and won some puck battles. After a scrum in which Antoine Roussel received several short punches as he was tied up by the officials (and no penalty called against the perpetrator), Roussel would find himself the beneficiary of a nice backdoor opportunity. He buried the puck, and had a true Roussel celebration with the goal post   a raw emotion scream _YEAH!Ó Dallas would find the equalizer a little later in the period when Benn seemingly called his own goal after a faceoff. You could see him discussing the faceoff strategy with John Klingberg. Benn would get the puck at the center of the blueline and absolutely blister one right past Mike Condon. Thatês the kind of leader Jamie Benn is   he leads by example on ice. Third Period Unfortunately, the good feelings did not last too much into the final frame. For the 12th game in a row, the Stars allowed three goals against when Mark Stone would get a wide open wraparound chance. Lehtonen was busy watching the play behind the net and wasnêt able to get over fast enough to the other side to cut off the bottom of the net.  Theyêd never get the equalizer, but not for lack of trying. Even with a late power play chance, and Jamie Benn et. al. playing basically the entirety of the man advantage, Dallas was dangerous but Condon was more than up to the challenge. Another missed opportunity for Dallas, as they basically beat themselves tonight.  "

That it was a shutout was icing on the cake. Anderson made his first start in 69 days and turned aside 33 shots as the Ottawa Senators beat the New York Islanders 3-0 on Saturday. Anderson left the club in early December to be with his wife, Nicholle, who is battling cancer, and returned to practice last week. ""It felt great. Got two points, got the win,"" he said. ""I think it was an exciting day for myself to get back in the net and just be there for the guys and feel that camaraderie. "" The shutout was the fourth of the season for Anderson in just 20 games and the eighth of the season for the Senators. Mike Condon has the other four. The win is the second straight for the Senators. ""I got a little luck and we got a little luck at the other end,"" Anderson said. ""It's one of those nights where fate was in our favor. "" Mark Stone, Zack Smith and Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored for the Senators (29-18-6), who now have six goals in their past two games after being outscored 10-0 in the two previous games. Thomas Greiss made 21 saves for the Islanders (24-19-10) in his eighth start in the past nine games. It was just the second regulation loss for the Islanders in their past 12 games. ""You have games like that but give credit to their goaltender. We probably could have done a better job getting more pucks toward the net, but I think there's a lot of things that we liked about our game,"" Islanders forward Andrew Ladd said. Stone opened the scoring at 4:10 of the first period. After stealing the puck from Alan Quine in the Islanders' zone, Stone fed Erik Karlsson, who missed the net with his shot. Stone followed up behind the net, collected the puck and banked a shot from behind the goal line off Greiss and in. Smith gave the Senators a 2-0 lead at 4:35 of the second period. Kyle Turrissent Smith in alone and he moved the puck from his backhand to his forehand to beat Greiss. A little less than three minutes later, Pageau put the Senators up 3-0 when he redirected a pass from Tom Pyatt past Greiss at 7:12. ""It was a great pass from Pyatt,"" Paguea said. ""In the defensive zone we wanted to cut off their play and break out on the attack and that's what Pyatt did and then he put the puck right on my stick. "" Paguea also gave credit to Anderson. ""He's been there for us since the beginning and he's a competitor. He's there every shift and he gave us the big saves when we needed them and we tried to make life easier for him out there,"" Paguea said. ""When your goaltender comes back after a long break, you want to go and be solid in front of him. I think the guys did that. "" The Islanders had two power plays in the second period and outshot the Senators 14-5 in the middle frame, but they were unable to get anything past Anderson. NOTES: Chris Neil, Curtis Lazar and Andrew Hammond were scratches for the Senators. Cal Clutterbuck, Stephen Gionta and Scott Mayfield were scratches for the Islanders. . Senators goaltender Andrew Hammond celebrated his 29th birthday on Saturday by being placed on waivers. ... The Islanders are 23-5-3 this season when they score at least three goals in a game. When they don't hit the three-goal mark, however, they are just 1-14-7. UP NEXT The Senators are off until Tuesday when they host the Buffalo Sabres. The Islanders host the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday.  ",Trevor Shackles,Craig Anderson Blanks Islanders in Return to Action,"Coming off a strange win against the Dallas Stars on Thursday, the Senators were looking to get on a roll with Craig Anderson back in the net after returning from time with his family.  Although the Islanders got off to an abysmal start to the 2016-17 season, they had been much better of late, going 7-1-2 since Doug Weight had taken over as head coach. New York was 8th in points percentage in the East heading into the matchup, so it wasnêt like Ottawa was facing a cellar dweller anymore. Things got out to a good start, as Mark Stone became the first Senator to hit the 20-goal mark just 4:10 into the game. According to Pierre Dorion, 8 fellow teammates will surely follow in getting to 20 goals this season.  It wasnêt the prettiest of finishes as he scored behind the net, but the turnover at the beginning of the play was vintage Stone. The rest of the period was encouraging, as the Islanders never seemed threatening, plus the only powerplay went to the Senators thanks to a late Jason Chimera hit on Stone. Despite New York coming out flying in the second period and leading in shots 6-1 early on, it was Ottawa that scored two goals on back to back shots three minutes apart. Both of them were quite beautiful if I do say so myself. First, Zack Smith finished off the play after two pretty passes, thwarting the momentum New York was beginning to build.  Right after the goal though, the Islanders had a chance to get back into it due to a Smith high-sticking penalty. After some time in the defensive zone, Chris Kelly was able to get it out, and from there Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Tom Pyatt would continue their excellent penalty kill by keeping the puck in the Islanders zone. Just as Smith was heading out of the box, all of a sudden Pyatt and Pageau were coming down on a dangerous 2-on-1. Pyatt waited until the last second to pass it over, and a little tap was all it took for the puck to go in off Pageauês stick to give Ottawa a 3-0 lead.  With the way Craig Anderson had played until that point, a 3-0 lead seemed pretty safe. However, that doensêt mean the Islanders stopped with their pressure. The second half of the period was predictably dominant from New Yorkês perspective, as they out-attempted Ottawa 23-10 at even strength and 31-10 overall.  It was no surprise that Ottawa sat back after going up 3-0, but luckily Anderson stood tall after 40 minutes to keep his shutout alive.  The third period was not much better than the second half of the second, and it was rather uneventful. It wasnêt good to see Ottawa sit back on their lead so much, but itês almost impossible to mitigate score effects.  Fittingly, Anderson finished the job and got his fourth shutout of the season, which was awesome to see. It was not the greatest of efforts, but they finished their chances when it mattered, winning with the final score being 3-0. After back to back worrying losses, Ottawa has now won two in a row and are seemingly back on track. Arenêt afternoon wins just the best? The rest of the day feels so great. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson What more can I say? His play speaks for itself. His last game before leaving the team in December was not pretty as he gave up seven goals against Pittsburgh. However, he has been fantastic outside of that game this season, and Iêm not surprised at all that he was able to come back and get a shutout right away. Honourable Mention: Jean-Gabriel Pageau/Tom Pyatt They both had a phenomenal penalty kill in the second period, and although Pageauês goal was not officially shorthanded, it essentially was. These two created a goal out of nothing at a time when it is very hard to score, and they gave the team some insurance with the third goal. Honourable Mention: Mark Stone The first goal was all thanks to him, and he continues to make plays that almost nobody can make. He forced turnovers out of nowhere and consistently won battles all around the ice. Weêre witnessing _Second Half of the Season Stone.Ó  ",Lighthouse Hockey,Anderson shuts out Isles in much-awaited return,"Folks, stop me if youêve heard this one before: the Islanders and Senators played a day game, and the Islanders did not play well. Today, the Islanders traveled to the Canadian capital to take on the Ottawa Senators as they looked to keep their hot streak alive. The lineup remained the same from the last game (as did the lines), with Cal Clutterbuck and Travis Hamonic continuing to nurse their injuries. Alan Quine played his first game in his hometown, while Shane Prince returned to Ottawa for the first time since being dealt here last season. Thomas Greiss remained in net, with JF Berube likely going against the terribad Colorado Avalanche tomorrow evening back in Brooklyn. The big story: Craig Anderson returns to make his first start since leaving to be with his wife, Nicholle, who has been battling cancer. Glad to have him back - the game is better with him. A great individual who helps us recognize and remember that life is more than just hockey. The Senators also held a moment of silence for Little Caesarês creator and longtime Red Wings owner Mike Illitch, who passed yesterday at the age of 87. Getting down to business, the Islanders are in the thick of the wild card race, which I still canêt believe. Oddly enough, they would be better suited to win todayês game in overtime (not the shootout, but overtime) than they would be in regulation. Pretty quirky, but whatever it takes! (Iêll also happily take a regulation win - even a shootout win, Iêm not too picky.) First Period: Not... ideal! The game got off to a fluky-but-in-a-negative-way start for the Isles. Mark Stone skated down the wing and hit Erik Karlsson in the slot. Karlssonês flubbed shot petered wide, but Stone had made his way behind the net and just threw the puck at the back of the skates of Greiss, trickling in behind him. The top line for the Islanders was dominating in their usual fashion in the first period, as they have been the last 10-20 games or so. Anderson had to be sharp - no time to be rusty. He was up to the challenge, though, and held the Isles off in the chances they had. The rest of the Islanders did not seem so awake, though. Overall, a not-great first period - for the second game in a row - that also saw an ugly penalty kill only bailed out by Greiss, in what would be a lone bright spot in an otherwise lackluster game for him. Second Period: Not what you want to do... The Islanders seemed primed to the task of a one-goal deficit, throwing four shots on Anderson within the first 90 seconds, with no luck. It would cost them. Dion Phaneuf sent a long pass to Kyle Turris. Turris carried over the line and sent a beautiful backhand feed to Zack Smith, who got Greiss to snow-angel. Making matters worse, John Tavares and much of PP1 stayed out way too long on Smithês penalty. Tom Pyatt poked it into the neutral zone and Jean-Gabriel Pageau joined him on a 2-on-1 against Johnny Boychuk, Tavares struggling to get back. Pageau tipped Pyattês pass over a falling Greiss to pretty much seal the deal. Third Period: Letês blow this popsicle stand The Isles seemed to think the deal was sealed as well. They checked out for the most part. The Senators did a good job of not letting shots to get through to Anderson, but the ones that Anderson did face were stopped easily. They seemed more ready to hop on the plane than anything else by this point, though they were delayed a bit by penalties to Prince and Tavares. Immediate Reaction: This was a forgettable one Well, they obviously werenêt going to win them all, but they really do seem to lose them at the worst times. As of this writing, the Flyers beat the Sharks in overtime, the Bruins stole a win away from the Canucks in the final minutes, and the Panthers are blowing out the Predators. The Stars lead the Hurricanes 4-1, so thatês something, but Detroit and Tampa Bay have their own games tonight, while the Maple Leafs host the Sabres. In other words, the Isles gained 0 points while most of their competitors seem primed to pick up at least one point. Ick. Up Next Donêt get too involved in anything besides hockey this weekend folks. Not only are there a metric ton of games implicated in our playoff push today, there are even more tomorrow - including another one of our own! The horrendous Avs begin a five-game Eastern Conference swing tonight against the Rangers, and stop by Brooklyn tomorrow evening for a 6:00 p.m. ET dinner-interrupting contest. Itêll be on MSG+, and it will also be an NHL.tv Free Game. Wonder if theyêll leave a Matt Duchene or Gabriel Landeskog shaped present for us before they go.  "

Lehner made 39 saves and Matt Moulson and Justin Bailey scored in the third period to rally the Sabres past the Ottawa Senators 3-2 on Tuesday night. This was the fifth and final meeting between the two teams this season, with Buffalo going 4-0-1. Lehner is 4-0-2 against the club that drafted him in the second round of the 2009 NHL draft. He was traded away with David Legwand in June 2015 to Buffalo for the 21st overall pick in that year's draft. ""This was a gutty effort,"" Sabres defenseman Josh Gorges said. ""We found a way. It wasn't pretty at times, it was a grinding type of hockey game and we were able to find a way, which is big. It's over now and we have to have the same kind of effort next game. "" Ryan O'Reilly also scored for the Sabres. Bobby Ryan ended a five-game run without a point by getting a goal and an assist for Ottawa. Dion Phaneuf also scored, and Craig Anderson made 22 saves. ""We didn't have a very good season series against them, we really didn't,"" Ottawa's Bobby Ryan said. ""I don't want to say we looked at the roster or the standings because they've had a long season with a lot of injured players. They're a very, very good team. It's not that we played down to their level because they've continued to outplay us in a lot of areas. ""I thought (Tuesday) was the exception. I thought we truthfully deserved better. "" After a solid start to the third period, Buffalo kept pushing and was rewarded when Bailey tipped Jake McCabe's point shot to take a 3-2 lead at 7:38. The Sabres tied it 51 seconds into the third when Moulson picked up a puck at the side of the net and put it over anderson 's back. ""It was a great response,"" Lehner said. ""We didn't panic in the second. It was a good feeling here. It was a 2-1 game on the road and that's not a bad situation. We came back, we score a goal and they were a little bit on their heels. "" Coming into the game, Buffalo had given up 62 second-period goals, third worst in the league. Tuesday night was no different as the Sabres were outshot 16-7. Ottawa made it 63 when Phaneuf jumped on a soft rebound and put the puck past Lehner to give the Senators a 2-1 lead. The Sabres opened the scoring on their first shot when O'Reilly used Phaneuf as a screen and beat Anderson low glove side. The Senators tied it at the 14-minute mark of the period when Ryan tipped Erik karlsson 's shot from the point. NOTES: Ottawa wrapped its four-game homestand 2-2-0. ... Senators D Chris Wideman was a late scratch due to a lower-body injury, and RW Curtis Lazar was a healthy scratch for the fourth straight game. ... Buffalo D Zach Bogosian returned to the lineup after missing the last six games with a rib injury, but LW Evander Kane did not play due to illness and D Taylor Fedunwas a healthy scratch. UP NEXT Sabres: Host Colorado on Thursday night to start a three-game homestand. Senators: Travel to play New Jersey on Thursday night.  ",Colin4000,"Lehner stands tall, Sabres beat Sens 3-2","In an extremely high-offense game for the Ottawa Senators, they couldnêt get past the brick wall Robin Lehner, who finished the night with 39 saves and a .951 SV%.  The Sens managed to get 50 unblocked shot attempts and 37 shots on goal at 5v5, which are both team highs on the season. Every Senator also managed to get a shot on goal, minus Chris Neil. The rapid firing still wasnêt enough, as the Buffalo Sabres took this game 3-2, for their 8th consecutive non-regulation loss against the Senators. Chris Wideman was a game time scratch with a lower-body injury, with Fredrik Claessonfilling in. Chris Neil also came into the lineup in place of Curtis Lazar, who weêll talk a bit about later.                                          Summary Faceoff, turnover, shot, goal. It was that quick for Ryan OêReilly to open up the scoring 24 seconds in, on the first rush of the game. Okposo fed the pass to OêReilly on his right, who wired a writer through Ceci and Phaneuf that beat Craig Anderson. Ottawa responded immediately with a ton of clean chances around the circles, but couldnêt get one past Lehner, who had a .961 SV% in seven career games against the Sens since being traded. Dmitry Kulikov took a hooking penalty eight minutes in, and the Sens proceeded to have one of their best power plays of the season. Passes were connecting, the puck was always moving, and it would always end up on Mike Hoffmanês stick with a point blank chance. Maybe it was the Sabresê lacklustre 29th ranked penalty kill that helped, but amassing seven shot attempts in a matter of two minutes is still very impressive.  After a plethora of chances, the Sens finally got on the scoreboard. Bobby Ryan scored his 12th goal of the season, his first in eight games, off a nice tip from an Erik Karlsson shot. It was a perfectly placed tip by Ryan, who was avoiding being knocked down by the Sabres defender. Although our expectations of Ryan have completely dropped, itês worth noting that heês now on pace for 19 goals on the season, or 21 over a full 82 games. Not to mention his Rel.xGF% has been steadily improving as well. The Sensê penalty kill came up large once again during a Mark Stone minor, shutting down the Sabresê league-leading power play to zero shots on goal. Forgetting the first 30 seconds, the Ottawa Senators were looking really good against their divisional opponent. The second period was a lot slower for the Sens, only registering a single shot on goal in the first half. Ottawaês PK unit stood tall for a second time, keeping scoring chances at a minimum.  20 minutes after Ryanês goal, the game was still locked even 1-1. The tie had to be broken eventually, and it was Dion Phaneuf who scored off an excellent rush coming from the other end. Dion picked up the puck in the Sensê defensive zone, proceeded to plough through multiple players in white, and dropped the puck for Bobby Ryan who fired the shot onto Lehner. Phaneuf kept driving to the net, and found the rebound which found the back of the net. Dion Phaneuf from Bobby Ryan, a $14 million goal, and it put the Sens up 2-1. If the offense hadnêt already running strong for Ottawa at that point, they took the final minute and a half and turned it up to 11. The pressure came from Pageau, Hoffman and Brassard, who couldêve scored an extra 2-3 goals had some bounces gone their way. Shot attempts were 10-0 in that span, pushing the periodês SOG total to double that of the Sabresê (14-7) heading into the locker room. The momentum would stop there, however, as 59 seconds into the third, Sam Reinhart would try to jam a shot by Anderson, which would fly in the air and bounce past the goal line. Matt Moulson would get credit for the goal as his stick nudged the puck as it was traveling in, although it would still be Reinhartês fifth point in his last five games. After a bit of back-and-forth hockey, Sabres rookie Justin Bailey would give Buffalo the 3-2 lead, with a high tip in front. Phaneuf and Ceci guarding the front of the net were rendered useless, as Bailey was somehow able to keep him body free to make the tip.  More offensive push from Ottawa and Craig Anderson being pulled in the final minute would lead to nothing, as Lehner continued to stand on his head and prevent Ottawa from getting the tying goal. The clock ticked down to zero, with the Sabres taking the full two points. Fun fact: Buffalo has now alternated wins and losses for eight consecutive games, dating back to January 31st. Sens Hero: Bobby Ryan After being seemingly invisible in recent games, Bobby Ryan was all but that, registering six shots on goal as well as seven hits. The last time Ryan had that many shots was on January 4th 2016, when he scored two goals and added an assist against the St. Louis Blues. Hits seven hits also ties a career single-game high for Ryan, throwing seven hits once with Anaheim back in 2011. Another fun fact: Bobby Ryan leads the Sens in first goals of the game with six, tied with Patrick Kane and Alex Ovechkin. Honourable Mention: Mike Hoffman The Hoff was by far the Sensê most lethal player for pure offense, registering seven shots on goal and getting looks left and right on the power play. Halfway through the game Hoffmanês CF% was still at 100%, with 10 shot attempts for before registering the first one against.  Honourable Mention: Fredrik Claesson What more does he have to do to stay in the lineup? The Sensê record holder for hardest shot didnêt hold back tonight, adding an assist in the process. He got a minute of power play time, which is a good sign.  Sens Zero: Phaneuf-Ceci Guy Boucherês love affair with the second pairing continued on Valentineês Day, giving them almost as much ice time at 5v5 as Karlsson and Methot. Although Phaneuf had that nice rush play to put the Sens up 2-1, there were many times, especially in the second period, where a Sabres forward would freely dance towards the net past one of the two and get a scoring chance.  Honourable Mention: Curtis Lazar Lazar was a healthy scratch tonight, and word is going around right now that heês planning on requesting a trade. I always think back to how he was playing in 2014-15 with Pageau and Condra, the best third line in the league at the time. Itês been only downhill for Lazar since then, and has been given ample opportunity to prove himself. His recent healthy scratches show that management is finally moving on from him, and for good reason. Every day it seems the odds of him being traded just keep increasing. Donêt get me wrong, I really hope Lazar can turn it around in Ottawa and be a steady contributor, but it appears as if the end of the line is near. Sens Killer: Robin Lehner Because of course he was outstanding.  Hey, at least Colin White scored two points last night! (Edit) Third Sens Zero: Hockey is for Everyone night After checking online this morning, all I'm hearing is that Hockey is for Everyone night was a complete failure. It was first off a poor organizational decision to place it on Valentine's Day, where they could easily divert marketing elsewhere. Then it was also a poor move to proceed to almost completely ignore it. Inclusion in hockey is definitely an issue that needs to be thoroughly addressed, and last night's attempt at a You Can Play night exposed the core of the Sens' and most of the NHL's position: they just don't care. What I'm hearing from those who attended the game was that there was a video at intermission focusing on inclusion of the disabled, which went unnoticed by many who were busy getting their intermission popcorn. There was no interview afterwards for Dion Phaneuf (the Sens' You Can Play ambassador), which is especially confusing since he also scored a goal. It was a huge fail for the organization, one that shouldn't go by without notice.  ",Die By the Blade,Sabres give fans a 3-2 Valentineês Day comeback,"Chocolates, flowers, a fancy dinner, or a comeback Sabres victory? If youêre like me, thereês only one answer for the best Valentineês Day gift one could get, and the Buffalo Sabres delivered just that tonight, coming back in the third period thanks to Justin Baileyês first career game-winning goal to beat the Ottawa Senators by a score of 3-2. According to the Sabres broadcast, it was Ottawaês first loss in franchise history on Valentineês Day.  The Sabres got off to a quick start, scoring just 24 seconds in to the game thanks to Ryan OêReilly, who tipped an Okposo shot past Craig Anderson to give the Sabres an early lead. It was a nice release of steam after a few days of contentious-but-constructive locker room talk, and a welcome relief to Sabres fans looking for some jump out of their team. Ottawa would score the next two goals, one in the first from Bobby Ryan and one in the second from Dion Phaneuf, and the Sabres would suffer their typical second period woes, getting outshot 16-7 and exiting the period down 2-1.  However, as theyêve done with increasing regularity, the Sabres would mount a courageous third period comeback, getting goals from Matt Moulson and Justin Bailey en route to a 3-2 win.  With the win, the Sabres have tied Pittsburgh and Montreal for the most come-from-behind wins when trailing after two in the NHL, with seven on the season.  Three Questions 1. Will Buffalo  stick to the system  more tonight, and will it make a difference? There was some good and some bad tonight - the obvious good was the quick goal and the comeback win, and the obvious bad was the business-as-usual awful second period. It was nice to see the Sabres come out in another big divisional game and give a generally strong effort.  2. Can Robin Lehner continue to dominate the Senators? Lehner won again against his old team, bringing his record to 4-2-0 against his old team. Lehner was very strong in the second and third, allowing the Sabres to stay in, and eventually win, the game. 3. Which player featured on the Sabres Valentines Day cards will have the biggest impact on tonightês game? Ryan OêReilly scored the opening goal and was dangerous in the offensive zone all night. He came within a few inches of an empty net goal, but overall played a very strong game game tonight.  "

Condon made 21 saves in recording his fifth shutout of the season, and his father, Ted, got a gift to commemorate the Senators' 3-0 win over the New Jersey Devils on Thursday night. Mike Condon said it was the first time his father has been in attendance for one of his six NHL shutouts. ""I got the puck for him, and that'll be special, and he'll have this memory for a long time,"" Condon said. ""(I) saw the video of him cringing up in the stands during the game. Not easy for goalie dads to be out there watching their kids play, and I can't even imagine what it's like. I'm happy to give him a good result. "" The tight checking game was scoreless until Dion Phaneuf scored on a power play late in the second period. The Senators didn't ice the game until the final four minutes, when Erik Karlsson scored on a point shot that crawled into the net and Kyle Turris shot into an empty net. The win was the Senators their third in four games, and it moved them within four point of first-place Montreal in the Atlantic Division. The Canadiens also have played three more games than Ottawa. ""We're not looking at that,"" Karlsson said. ""We need to take care of ourselves. We can't really focus on what other teams are doing. I feel we've done a good job to put ourselves in this position, and we're happy where we are, but we're here to win games. "" Cory Schneider stopped 32 shots, but the Devils lost for the second time in regulation (4-2-1) in their last seven games. New Jersey remains five points behind Toronto for the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference, but it has played one more game. ""I thought for the most part we did the right things in the first two periods and then in the third, they just squeezed us a little harder and we were not able to execute quite as well and get in and get some sustained shots,"" Schneider said. ""They just outplayed us in the third, and when you are down a goal, that is not the way to go. "" Phaneuf broke a scoreless tie with a rocket from the left point with 1:59 left in the second period. The puck hit the upper right corner of the net and came out quickly, leaving some players wondering whether the puck had gone in the goal. A video review upheld phaneuf 's ninth of the season and third in four games. Karlsson made it 2-0 with a shot from the right point that Schneider slowed down but let trickle into the net. Condon had the best saves in a scoreless first period. He stopped Beau Bennett in close six-plus minutes into the game. He denied Kyle Palmieri on a shot from the inside the right circle at 4:37 to go and seconds later stopped blast by defenseman Ben Lovejoy from between the circles. Bennett also hit the post early in the second period. NOTES: Senators LW Tom Pyatt, who turned 30 on Tuesday, played in his 300th NHL game. ... Bennett returned to the lineup after missing nine games (ankle). ... Condon picked up a delay of game penalty eight seconds after the opening faceoff. ... Ottawa RW Curtis Lazar was in the lineup after being a healthy scratch for four games. Chris Neil was scratched. ... Senators D Marc Methot was ill and did not play. ... Devils are 6-19-2 when trailing after two periods. UP NEXT: Senators: Visit Toronto on Saturday night for the fourth and final game of season series. Devils: Host the New York Islanders on Saturday night in the first of a home-and-home on consecutive days.  ",Ross A,Sens shut out Devils 3-0,"This was a game that the Senators desperately needed. Guy Boucherês _The SystemÓ was on full display. The Sens held what shouldêve been an easy opponent to a low number of shots. Mike Condon looked like a capable backup, earning a shutout after getting a couple days off. A 3-0 victory over the 13th-in-the-East Devils was just what the doctor ordered. If Iêm being honest, I hardly remember the first period after Condon taking a puck-over-glass penalty eight seconds (!!) into the game. The shots were even, the chances werenêt memorable, and it basically just happened. The second period, things really came alive for the Sens. They outshot them 16-7 and outdrew them in penalties 2-0. Dion Phaneuf got the lone goal, a powerplay blast from the point. The goal briefly gave him the teamês sole lead in goals among defencemen with nine. The third period though was where things really worked for the Sens. Somehow the team managed to control most of play being up by a goal. They essentially choked the life out of the Devils. Late in the period, Erik Karlsson caught back up to Phaneuf in goals (that sounds weird to say) with the definition of a squeaker: his shot from the point snuck through Cory Schneiderand very slowly crept behind him until it came to rest a couple inches behind the goal-line before it got swept away. Kyle Turris would then wrap it up with an empty-netter after Zack Smith very unselfishly passed it over to him at the blue-line. That sealed a 3-0 victory for the Sens. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson The captain showed up in a big way tonight. He kept play going the other way all night, and was rewarded with a goal near the end. He finished with nearly 28 minutes on the ice and four shots on goal. And hey, he spent 11 minutes with Fredrik Claesson who also had a great night. Honourable Mention: Mike Condon I donêt remember any flashy saves from him tonight, but the Sens didnêt need any. He made every save that was asked of him. Itês impossible to win without a dependable goalie, and thatês what he was tonight.  ",All About the Jersey,Anemic performance by Devils leads to 3-0 loss to Senators,"The Devils, looking to build off a great performance against Colorado, faced a Senators team that had just lost to the Sabres 3-2.  With this game, it seems safe to say the Devils failed to achieve their goal. Badly. In the first period, both teams started off lacking in energy. There was a Devils power play to immediately start off the game, but the Devils made nothing of it. Beau Bennett made his presence known in his first game back, using his speed and puck possession skills to drive the zone and nearly stuff in a rebound. The Devils defensemen played well as well. Riley Dzingel used his speed to cause problems, but the Devils defense neutralized him throughout the first. Kyle Turris had the best chance of the first for the Senators, off a rebounded Mike Hoffman shot. The Devils then had a Kyle Palmieri 2-on-1 opportunity, but it was stuffed by Condon. Ben Lovejoy shouldêve scored on a slapshot in the slot, but it was unluckily blocked by Kyle Palmieri before it could enter the net. Overall, the first period was the best period for the Devils.  In the second, the Devils and Senators were even to start off the second. Jacob Josefson took a penalty two minutes in, but the Devils killed it off rather easily. The Devils actually outplayed the Senators possession wise during the first part of the 2nd, but then Mike Cammalleri got a penalty, and the Senators capitalized with a Dion Phaneuf slap shot. After this goal, the Senators got new life, and played like the team a goal down. Within the last two minutes, the Sabres dominated the puck, and on the period ended up outshooting the Devils 16-7.  The third period was as if the Devils didnêt even care. It appeared as if their play got more lackadaisical, and the Senators capitalized on this. For a team trailing, the Senators dominated possession and play. The period was again dreadful, with the Senators outshooting the Devils 12-6. With four minutes left, Erik Karlsson took a wrister from the point, which trickled by Schneider and in. Then, with the empty net, Kyle Turris iced the game, and the final score was 3-0. When a team is down, they should be playing with a sense of urgency. From what I saw, it seemed as if the Devils had no urgency at all. They seemed to give up, and let the Senators dictate play for all of the third. That is unacceptable for a team down, and supposedly still in the playoff hunt.  The Game Stats: The NHL.com Game Summary | The NHL.com Event Summary | The NHL.com Play-by-Play Summary | The NHL.com Shot Summary | The Natural Stat Trick Game Stats | The HockeyStats.Ca Game Stats |  The Opposition Opinion: Ross A wrote a short recap here.  Bad Corsi All-Around: No player on the Devils had a positive Corsi difference this game. The only players who were actually even rated were Jacob Josefson (who I actually thought played well) and PA Parenteau. The worst players according to Corsi were Stefan Noesen and Jon Merrill. From what I saw, Noesen was actually moved down to the fourth line in this game, which was a shame considering no spark was added with this move. Mike Cammalleri, with his recent string of bad play, actually had one of the better Corsiês on the night with a -1. Take this with a grain of salt though, as his 13:40 minutes of ice time is four minutes lower than his average ice time. Itês become evident that Hynes is losing trust in him as of late, as his ice time continues to dwindle. With no goals in his last 19 games, Cammalleri needs to perform better. Some of his recent play has been questionable, but heês definitely a talented player who should be scoring more for this Devils team.  The Positives: The discipline was better in this game, although the Devils didnêt really play with much heart or emotion. Blandisiês presence took away the grinder/pest role that the Devils had in the past few games, and he couldêve provided a spark in this game. Regardless, after giving up 6 power plays in the Sharks game, the discipline has been a lot better as of late.  Taylor Hall and Kyle Palmieri didnêt show up on the score sheet, but they were some of the only Devils that consistently tried to make plays and drive forward the offense. Hall made some key passes to set up opportunities, and Palmieri had himself a couple scoring chances. Most other Devils forwards were either lethargic, or played with little-to-no emotion (Cammalleri had no shot attempts). Tonight, Ben Lovejoy and Andy Greene were the best defenseman the Devils had. Lovejoy and Greene held their ground against Ottawaês best offensive threats tonight, and showed why Hynes trusts them as a top pairing defense. Lovejoy has been criticized a good amount this year for his underwhelming play, but he was mostly solid tonight. Him and Greene had two blocks each, and did a good job in neutralizing the young speedster Riley Dzingel, who played exceptionally tonight. While tonight was a pretty ugly game, there were some positives that could be taken from it.  Trade Deadline? Earlier this week, PA Parenteau mentioned how this stretch of games would determine if the Devils would be sellers. Well, yesterday FanSided posted an article stating how the Devils are likely to trade him and Kyle Quincey. From an outside perspective, it looks like the Devils would be giving up on the season. However, in my eyes, it could just be Shero getting value for unnecessary assets. In the past games, PA Parenteau has been consistently on the 4th line, and getting little ice time. His stats are nice, but they arenêt completely indicative of how he plays. Heês been invisible at times, and is a streaky scorer (just like most players on the Devils). Kyle Quincey, on the other hand, looks pretty good based on stats alone. He has four goals, and actually has a positive +/- on the year. However, with Santini and Merrill playing well, Hynes and Shero may see Quincey as disposable now.  Personally, I wouldnêt mind seeing both of them traded, because I just donêt think they help the team all that much. But, let me know what you guys think in the comments below.  Speedy Senators: The Senators have an abundance of young, dangerous forwards on their team. Riley Dzingel, as mentioned before, used his speed to his advantage throughout the game. Kyle Turris is an amazing, borderline star player, and he caused trouble for the Devils today. Mike Hoffman and Mark Stone may be the most underrated forwards in the NHL, because while people know theyêre good players, they may not appreciate just how good they are. All of these players, as well as others like Jean-Gabriel Pageau, Derick Brassard, Zack Smith and even Tom Pyatt, played essential roles in the Senators win tonight. The future looks bright for these Sens.  Schneider Left To Dry: Of the two goals Schneider gave up, only Erikssonês was really really bad. Schneider was the reason, particularly in the second and third, that the Devils were even so close in this game. He saved 32/34, and was the best Devil on the ice today. Unfortunately, the Devils applied little pressure on Mike Condon aside from bits in the 1st period and the first 5 minutes or so in the second. Schneiderês play has really picked up of late, and the Devils canêt continue to waste performances from him like today.  "

Mark Stone had a goal and four assists, Derick Brassard scored twice in the third period and the Senators recovered after blowing a two-goal lead to beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-3 on Saturday night. The Senators pulled within two points of Montreal for first place in the Atlantic Division with three games in hand. ""We like where we're at. We're in a good spot,"" Stone said. ""But there's a little bit more that we want. Obviously, there's teams coming and we want to try and create separation, so the only way to do that is keep winning hockey games. "" Ottawa led 2-0 after one period but trailed 3-2 in the third before getting a tying goal from Mike Hoffman and a power-play goal from Brassard. Stone and Brassard added empty-netters, and Chris Wideman and Ryan Dzingelalso scored for the Senators. Ottawa has won four of five overall and three of four against the Leafs this season. Craig Anderson stopped 34 shots. Morgan Rielly, Nazem Kadri and William Nylander scored and Auston Matthews had two assists for the Maple Leafs. Frederik Andersen allowed four goals on 40 shots. Toronto has lost eight of 11 and entered the night with a tenuous grip on the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. ""The reality is we're all big boys, we can read the standings. You've got to win hockey games,"" Babcock said. After Nylander made it 3-2 with a power-play goal 2:04 into the third, Hoffman tied it by rifling a shot from the right faceoff circle off the post and in. On a power play 54 seconds later, Andersen stopped Erik karlsson 's point shot, but Brassard jumped on the rebound and put it in for a 4-3 lead. Wideman started the scoring in the first, firing a point shot through traffic moments after Stone beat Nikita Zaitsev for a puck behind the Leafs goal. Dzingel added to the lead when he deflected Marc Methot's point shot 20 seconds later. Andersen stopped three shots during a lengthy 5-on-3 during the second period, and the Leafs got on the board about three minutes later. Rielly scored with 5:22 left in the second by chasing down a wide shot from Matthews, carrying it to the point and shooting through a crowd in front. About three minutes later, Zaitsev fired a shot from the right point that sneaked through anderson 's pads and slid behind the net. Kadri chased it down and banked it off Dzingel's helmet and in for his 24th goal of the season. Dzingel had fallen in the crease trying to prevent Kadri from stuffing the rebound in. ""Our game plan didn't change for the third period, and that's just the maturity we're gaining over time,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""Our leaders have been doing a great job, but collectively, the team has grown dramatically in terms of having poise, executing under pressure. "" NOTES: Mitch Marner sat out for Toronto with an upper-body injury. Marner leads Toronto with 48 points and is also expected to sit Sunday night against Carolina. UP NEXT Senators: Host Winnipeg on Sunday night. Maple Leafs: Travel to Carolina for a game Sunday night.  ",Ary M,"Stoneês 5 points help Sens vanquish Leafs, 6-3","For the first 30 minutes of tonightês contest, the Sens were playing a perfect road game. They were up by two, while out-shooting AND out-chancing the Toronto Maple Leafs. But after failing to generate a scoring chance on a 1:49-long 5-on-3 powerplay, the Leafs scored twice to tie the game heading into the third period before taking the lead on a powerplay. Instead of the usual _shutdownÓ hockey we expect to see from Boucherês Sens, the offence stepped up and scored four in the final frame to give the Sens two crucial points. This was the scenario heading into tonight, and the pressure was only compounded by the recent winning streaks of the vaunted Buffalo Sabres and the resurgent Florida Panthers. Combined with the glimmer of opportunity by way of the fading Montreal Canadiens, and you can garner why tonight was an important game for many reasons. From puck drop, Mark Stone led the way.  The first period was as offensive as weêve seen the Sens all season, with Erik Karlsson actively generating three scoring chances on his first couple of shifts but failing to solve Frederik Andersen. One of the (many) differences between the Sens and Leafs is their offensive zone forecheck, with the Sens preferring to trap teams in the neutral zone in order to generate NZ turnovers while the Leafs preferring to Çpressê two forwards and generate offensive zone turnovers. The Sens, especially the trio of Erik Karlsson, Chris Wideman, and Dion Phaneuf, expertly handled the Leafs aggressive forecheck early on and were able to exploit its weakness: if you can move the puck quick enough in your defensive zone, thereês space to generate odd-player advantages in transition. In the first period, the Sens two fastest forwards   Hoffman and Dzingel   exploited this weakness with Hoffman generating a mid-period penalty on Jake Gardiner while Dzingel using the advantage to drive the net ferociously on the Sens first goal. Dzingel was stoned by Andersen on his initial chance, but Stoneês good work down low allowed him to get the puck up to Derick Brassard at the high point. Brassard then expertly facilitated the cross-ice transition to Chris Wideman, who blasted the puck off of Morgan Rielly and past Andersen for a 1-0 lead. On the next shift, Brassard wins the puck back to Methot on the left point, where he plays pitch-and-catch with Stone on the left wall to open up some separation. As Methot hammers the puck on the net, Ryan Dzingel is screening Andersen and tips the puck past the Danish netminder for a 2-0 lead heading into the first intermission. The first 10 minutes of the second followed the same script as the first, and when Matt Martin and Zach Hyman took penalties 11 seconds apart, the Sens had a golden opportunity to take a commanding 3-0 lead on an extended 5-on-3. Instead, what we saw was the most putrid powerplay imaginable, with the powerplay group failing to shrink the ice and moving the puck slowly without any shots on net. Itês no surprise the team hasnêt scored on it since April 2015 (vs. WSH), and that the Leafs were the team to build momentum off a big kill. After the Sens iced the puck, the Hyman - Matthews - Nylander line went to work in the offensive zone and ultimately got the puck back to Morgan Rielly, who flicked one through a screen and past a wailing Craig Anderson to get the Leafs on the board.  Two minutes later, Cody Ceci bobbles a puck off a won draw in the offensive zone and Josh Leivo is able to burst into the offensive zone. The Leafs set-up, and eventually, the puck works its way back to Nikita Zaitsev who wrists the puck through Anderson. Ryan Dzingel notices the trickling puck and dives into the crease to successfully block it, but in doing so, gets caught lying down and stopping Anderson from securing his right post. Nazem Kadri, down low on the puck retrieval, notices this and beats Ceci for the puck before banking the puck off of Dzingelês head and into the net to knot the game at 2. The Leafs carry their momentum into the third, and quickly go on the powerplay as Zack Smith gets called for _hookingÓ Zach Hyman. The Sens PK, 3/3 on the night, miss their best penalty killer and pay for it as Matthews finds Nylander on a sweet cross-ice pass before the Swede snaps it past Anderson for a 3-2 lead. At this point, the Sens have been in _weather the stormÓ mode for the last 10 minutes of game-time and Toronto almost takes a 4-2 lead off a Kadri shot before Mark Borowiecki, playing with Chris Kellyês stick, sweeps it away. The tone changes, though, when Erik Karlsson, Kyle Turris, and Mike Hoffman use their skill to create something out of nothing. It starts with Karlsson, who intercepts an errant Rielly ring-around-the-boards by using his speed to dart to the right point. He gets the puck to Turris down-low, who makes three defenders turn the wrong way before putting a slick backhand feed right onto the tape of Mike Hoffman, whoês speeding into the zone off the bench. The puck is on Hoffmanês stick for a split second and then behind Andersen, leaving the goal light person, Andersen, and the crowd stunned.   On the next shift, the referees make up for the soft call on Smith by calling Kadri for a slight hold on Chris Wideman in the defensive zone, sending the Sens to the powerplay. This time, the group is a lot more active as a won Turris draw quickly results in an Erik Karlsson point shot. Mark Stone, the smartest player on the ice, always knows where he is and is able to get to the rebound first. He isnêt able to cash it in himself, but Brassard, waiting on the left side of the net, pots the puck to give the Sens a 4-3 lead, less than a minute after tying it.  Up by one, the Sens stick to their system and attempt to bottle up the Leafs for the remaining 10 minutes. It works (they donêt score!) but isnêt nearly as effective as Boucher would like, as the Leafs control the puck for much of the rest of the game. Mike Babcock decides to pull Andersen with 2:25 remaining, despite constant Leafs pressure already, and his team nearly capitalizes on a couple of net front plays. After Tom Pyatt and Zack Smith couldnêt get the puck out despite Karlssonês best efforts to get them the puck, Kyle Turris scrums a draw and Mark Stone fires the puck 150ft down the ice for his 21st of the year. With the net pulled again, Stone gets a lucky bounce on a defensive zone clear off a stanchion and Brassard pots his 11th of the year to give the Sens the 6-3 victory.  Sens Hero: Mark Stone Nothing really for me to say, other than heês now closed the gap on Karlsson for the team lead in points and definitely deserves a ton of votes for the Selke.   Sens Heroes: Zack Smith + Erik Karlsson Both were fantastic defensively tonight. Smith was a big part of the Sens first three penalty kills and was relentless on the forecheck, while Karlsson made a number of smooth zone exits en route to a 62% CF% rating.  Honourable Mention: Craig Anderson He let in three goals, but it was a high event game (98 shot attempts, shots 42-37 OTT). I thought Anderson was sharp with his reflexes, especially in front of his net. The Leafs got a TON of pucks to the net but Anderson was there to make a couple of game-saving stops, especially in the third, to keep his team in it.  ",Pension Plan Puppet,Toronto Maple Leafs lose 6-3 to the Ottawa Senators,"We recap every Maple Leafs game, but I rarely write any of them on Saturday night - or ever - because I'm usually tipsy from drinking adult beverages while watching the game. However, there is no one else available tonight, so you are stuck with me and my beer goggles. This should be fun! I'm doing this stream of consciousness style because try and stop me, Overlord Steve! Hereês my recap of all that happened tonight as the Leafs lost 6-3 to the Senators.  PRE-GAME So, I just got home from the Marlies game, and they won 1-0 vs. the Manitoba Moose. It was a weird game, and kind of boring after yesterday's 5-2 victory. Sparks looked good in net, and he needed to be. Froese was out with a mystery injury. But, you can read more about this in my Marlies recap which is located at this link ---> (Look, I haven't had time to do it yet because I'm doing this.)  It's Hockey Day in Canada. Who knew? I bet we're going to get a teary-eyed montage of self-absorbed cheering for Canada because EVERYONE in this country grew up playing hockey on a frozen pond in a small town, and that certainly hasn't changed in the past 100 years at all. We all still live in small towns and dream of being hockey stars. And there's the teary-eyed nationalistic hockey montage. That couple in the Secrets Resorts and Spa ceremony had a vacation just like JvR and I had together. Seriously. We did all those things including the bubble bath with our fancy clothes on which is totally something sexy people do together, though everyone else knows it is fucking stupid. Again. Youêre stuck with me tonight, folks. I was hoping Chris Neil would have been called up to do the ceremonial puck drop and Wendel would jersey him and knee him in the groin, but, alas, it's Erik Karlsson. Martina Ortiz-Luis is no longer referred to as _fifteen year-old Martina Ortiz-Luis,Ó which is good. It was making a caricature out of her. The game features Andersen vs. Anderson. They are already trying to confuse me. FIRST PERIOD 20:00 Oh crap I have to pay attention now.  19:45 Dion Phaneuf gets the first shot because of course he does. 19:00 JvR gets off a great shot on a breakaway. It didn't go in, but, clearly he can score with his clothes on. 17:10 William Nylander does a hilarious double lap around the net. Who was it who did that once before? Was it Ovechkin? 16:00 JvR has another nice scoring chance again in the four-on-four. 15:10 Frederik Andersen makes a great stop on Turris. This four-on-four is great hockey, btw. When I cover the Marlies four-on-four is usually boring. 14:20 Roman Polak gets the puck on his stick and shoots immediately. Because that's all he does now. CBC please stop using that weird ice level camera for face-offs 13:50 Dzingel and Nikita Zaitsev spar post-whistle in the battle of _ZÓ. Brigstew could take them both at once I think. 13:20 Nikita Soshnikov takes a shot and I see he gets hooked and there's something starting but CBC cuts away and shows none of it and I wanted to see. 12:40 Jake Gardiner breaks up a scoring chance by the Senators but it looks like he did it by accident and has no idea what happened. 10:50 Soshnikov has had a lot of great plays this season that don't show up on the score sheet. 10:15 Penalty kill is OK. Just OK. Andersen snatches a scoring chance a way from Stone and gets it clear. 9:15 Nylander wraps around and sets up a beauty of a scoring chance for Matthews but there's too much traffic in front of the net 9:00 Andersen stops a huge slapshot from Jean-Gabriel Pugeaut. 7:39 Leo Komarov draws a penalty! Power-play time. 24-51-29-12-34 STOP WITH THE WEIRD CAMERA ANGLES, CBC! 6:06 Kyle Turris grabs Zaitsev's jersey and we have another Sens penalty. 22 seconds of five-on-three 4:21 Get out of the way, ref! Also Leivo on the PP? OK.  2:51 Turnover again leads to a Senators scoring chance that almost goes in...  2:34 TURNOVER AGAIN leads to Senators scoring chance. This one does go in. Goal by Wideman. 2:14 UGH. Sens score again off the face-off. Let's just get this period over with. 1:46 LOL Bobby Ryan gets a weird delay of game penalty. 1:18 Language, James! This is a family game. 1:06 OH FUCKING FUCK GARDINER? WHAT THE FUCK? What is going on with you tonight? Gardiner gives it away again, right at the net again! 0:03 Oh, right, Tommy Wingels plays for the Senators now.  SECOND PERIOD 20:00 Gardiner is not benched. Remember when Randy Carlyle would do dumb shit like that? 18:45 Zaitsev makes a great block. 18:17 _You lose a stick. You lose a stick. Everyone loses a stick!Ó 15:55 Polak : _I HAVE PUCK I SHOOT PUCK HARD!Ó 15:00 I am not liking the Leivo-Kadri-Komarov line. To borrow an aphorism, _thereês no there there.Ó They canêt seem to make anything happen. The Philadelphia Cream Cheese budget meeting commercial is awful. Nothing will ever top the OLGês _surprise big budget meetingÓ commercial in this category. 11:52 Andersen standing on his head. Guess which defence pairing was on the ice that necessitated he do that? 10:31 Martin off for interference. He must miss not having Marner on the bench. 10:20 UGH now Zach Hyman takes a penalty. Leafs facing 1:49 of 5 on 3 play. 10:20 The Senators have yet to score on a five-on-three this season so.... 9:35 OMGBENSMITH! taking the PK face-off.  9:00 Hunwick clears it. Good, Hunwick! 8:31 LOLSNES. Another five-on-three fail. And a total PK fail! Credit where it is due: good work by Komarov, Hunwick, and Smith there.  7:47 NOOOO BROWN! A trip to the dentist for you! 6:30 Another shift of the Leivo-Kadri-Komarov line and there was zero ability for them to break-out or run the Senators defence. 5:43 Now I donêt know what the hell is going on. Gardiner is carrying the puck in to the attacking zone, but heês way ahead of all the forwards and all he can do is pass it over to Bozak who is well covered. 5:22 OMG A GOAL! Thank you Rielly. The Leafs are back in this. Also thank you Hyman for doing that thing you did with the Marlies last season. 2:30 Matthews and Nylander seem confused about who should be where at times. They almost ran into each other because they were both chasing the puck.  Overhead shot of Toronto reminds they STILL have not finished the new roof to Union GO Station. Itês been like 5 years? WTF are they doing? 2:10 HOW DID THAT NOT GO IN? 2:09 NAZ! LOL Right off Andersonês back. That was a great shot. So of course right after I tweet out my displeasure with the line they score a great goal. 1:00 The Leafs are finally looking like I remember them from the past few games. the Bozak line has a great shift. THIRD PERIOD 20:00 Leivo-Kadri-Komarov still together. Despite the goal I am surprised Babcock didnêt shake up that line. 19:15 Nice penalty draw by Hyman against Ceci. 18:39 Great scoring chance by Bozak! 18:15 Gardiner attempts a weird backwards pass he didnêt need to and turns over the puck. 17:56 OMG NYLANDER! 14:26 Now Hoffman scores to tie the game. That really looked like Andersen could not have anticipated it. 13:48 The _Call Kadri for anything and everythingÓ rule is still in effect. 13:34 This is not going well. <I missed about 5 minutes of the game here because I was writing up this recap!> 6:30 Fuck you Chris Neil. What a cheap shot. 5:10 Nylander, Hyman get awesome chances and miss/post. Great shift but you gotta get it in there! LOL, Boston Pizza, please. Donêt even try to pretend throwing Italian words into your commercials makes anyone think your food is good. 2:10 Andersen is pulled from the net. 2:05 Nylanderês chance was great there. Bozak-Kadri-Leivo-Carrick-JvR-Gardiner out for the six-on-five. 1:50 WHELP. That pulling the goalie early thing didnêt work. 0:40 WHELP. That pulling the goalie early thing didnêt work AGAIN. 0:00 the Leafs fall to the Senators.  "

Josh Morrissey scored early in the third period to give Winnipeg a two-goal lead, and the Jets held on for a 3-2 victory over the Senators. Already without forward Bobby Ryan because of an injured finger, Ottawa lost three more key forwards against Winnipeg: Mike Hoffman, Tommy Wingels and Mark Stone. ""At some point it felt like there was nobody on the bench, but a lot of character on our bench and our guys played to the end,"" said Boucher, who had no specific update on any of the injuries. ""I thought we deserved a much, much better fate. "" Hoffman left in the first period with an undisclosed injury. Stone took an elbow to the head from Jacob Trouba seven minutes into the third and didn't return. Wingels also exited in the third. ""It doesn't look good. We have to wait until tomorrow to be clear and precise, but right now we could be losing quite a few guys,"" Boucher said. Morrissey made it 3-1 at 2:33 when his wrist shot from the blue line eluded Senators goalie Mike Condon. Dustin Byfuglien and Mathieu Perreault also scored for the Jets, who won their second consecutive game. Mark Scheifele and Patrik Laine each had two assists, and Connor Hellebuyck made 32 saves. Zack Smith pulled the Senators within a goal when a redirected pass hit his skate and went in at 5:05 of the third. Ottawa thought it had tied the game in the waning seconds, but a no-goal call stood when officials determined there was no conclusive evidence to overturn the ruling. ""From what we saw it went in. The guys that were there at the net said it did, but it was inconclusive so there's not much you can do,"" Smith said. ""It would have been nice to push that one to overtime because I like the way we were going towards the end. "" Stone had the other goal for the Senators, who also got two assists from Erik Karlsson and 17 saves from Condon. The Jets were outshot 10-7 in the first despite carrying most of the play. Six of Ottawa's shots came in the final four minutes of the period. Byfuglien opened the scoring 69 seconds into the game with a shot that beat Condon from the faceoff circle to his left. Perreault gave the Jets a 2-0 lead with a swing-around backhand from the top of the crease that beat Condon at 12:28 of the first. ""It was great to get off to a good start and get that goal right away. To get a 2-0 lead on the road is a great way to start a game,"" Jets captain Blake Wheeler said. The Senators had several chances in the period, none better than a 2-on-1 that ended with Wingels missing an open net following a pass from Curtis Lazar. stone 's power-play goal at 5:10 of the second cut it to 2-1. Stone took a pass from Karlsson and fired a quick shot from the slot over the left shoulder of Hellebuyck. NOTES: Ryan and Chris Neil were scratched by the Senators. Andrew Copp, Drew Stafford and Julian Melchori were the Winnipeg scratches. ... Senators D Mark Borowiecki began the day leading the NHL with 245 hits, 31 more than Toronto's Matt Martin, who was second. ... Jets forward Shawn Matthiasturned 29. ... The Jets have gone five straight games without a power-play goal and are 0 for 14 with the man advantage during that span. UP NEXT Jets: Play the last game before their bye week Tuesday in Toronto. Senators: At the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday.  ",Beata Elliott,"Ottawa Senators Fall 3-2 to Winnipeg Jets, Lose Stone and Hoffman","For fans of the Ottawa Senators, tonightês game against the Winnipeg Jets felt like a slap in the face. Only a few hours before puck drop, we had all been eagerly anticipating our seemingly inevitable rise to first in the division, after an exciting win over the Toronto Maple Leafscombined with a Habs loss had put the team only two points behind the Montreal Canadiens. But now, things could hardly look more bleak. These kinds of games are the worst, because theyêre not losses you can easily brush off and convince yourself are just flukes, theyêre games that make you wonder about the rest of the season. Our mood hardly would have changed had Pageauês goal been allowed, because once Hoffman and Stone left the game, the entire outlook of this season shifted, and not for the better. Iêm not going to write this season off yet, because we still donêt know how serious either of the injuries are and thereês still time for Stone and Hoffman to recover even if they are, but man, that game really sucked. The Jets opened the scoring only a minute into the first period, when Dustin Byfuglien fired one past Condon. The Sens spent significant time in the offensive zone and got a few decent chances, but didnêt quite look like themselves throughout the first frame. Winnipeg scored another goal to go up 2-0, with Laine getting two assists early in the game. Isnêt it an honour to see a top prospect dominate against us? Not like thatês ever happened before. The Sens had to start the second period without Mike Hoffman, as the left winger left the game with a mysterious lower body injury, the cause of which remains a mystery. Letês all hope heês not too seriously injured, because heês an essential part of Ottawaês lineup. Since the Sens were already rolling only 11 forwards, Hoffmanês spot was taken by defenseman Fredrik Claesson. Putting Claesson on forward was an interesting decision, as there are plenty of Sens blueliners better suited to the position. Personally, I would have gone with Borowiecki. He does have experience playing forward, after all. (That was sarcasm, in case you couldnêt tell.) Speaking of Borowiecki, the defenseman/forward looked injured after blocking two shots in the same shift, but soon returned to the game, to the surprise of absolutely no one. Heês annoying that way. A Senators powerplay early in the second led to a goal by Mark Stone, after Karlsson made a nifty play to set him up in the slot. Karlssonês assist put him at 50 points for the season. The Sens looked considerably better after that, and ended the period down by only one goal. Winnipeg got one back, however, when Josh Morrissey capitalized on a defensive lapse from Ottawa. The goal bounced off Cody Ceci, who has scored considerably more goals into his own net than into opponentsê nets this season. The last good thing to come out of the game was a Smith redirection off a Karlsson shot that found the back of the net to once again move the Sens to within one goal. Shortly afterward, Mark Stone ended up on the receiving end of a nasty head shot from Jacob Trouba, and went off to the dressing room looking concussed. Considering this is Stoneês second concussion this season, and that he was hit to the head by Dustin Byfuglien a year ago, Sens fans have good reason to be worried about his health, both in the short term and the long term. Look, Iêm not just saying this because Mark Stone was hurt: those kinds of hits should not be legal. Trouba made an extremely careless and dangerous play and I could not care less if it was intentional or not. If thereês contact to the head, there should be a minimum sentence. This kind of stuff is ruining careers and there is absolutely no point to it. Of course, because nothing was allowed to go Ottawaês way, Tommy Wingels also left the game with an apparent injury. Wingels isnêt exactly the most important player on the team, but being down to 8 forwards (or 9, once Neil draws back into the lineup) is a pretty tough situation to be in. Weêve now lost Ryan, Hoffman, Stone and Wingels. Thatês rough. With only a few seconds left in the game, Pageau tapped the puck in past Hellebuyck, but the refs didnêt notice and the buzzer sounded. After review, the play was deemed inconclusive and the goal was waived off, but video replay sure made it look like a goal. It was a fitting end to a terrible game. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson The captain had two assists and generally looked dominant throughout the entire 60 minutes. With the Sensê two best forwards out, he and Kyle Turris will really have to step up in the coming games if Ottawa is going to keep winning. Honourable Mention: Mark Stone I canêt really put him as a hero since he didnêt play the whole game, but Stone looked pretty good too. Iêm really sad about him right now. Sens Killer: Injuries Again, Iêm just sad about this.  ",,,
58,1 Regular,2/21/2017,7:00 PM,A,New Jersey Devils,2,1,W,,32,20,6,W 1,23,7,1,2,0,30,7,1,1,0,"12,343",2:16,"Undermanned Senators sweep Devils, Anderson makes 29 saves","The Ottawa Senators were without three top forwards Tuesday night, so they had to make up for it with defense and goaltending. Craig Anderson made 29 saves and the Senators beat the New Jersey Devils 2-1 on Tuesday night to stay within two points of Montreal in the race for first place in the Atlantic Division. Ottawa was without Mark Stone (22 goals), Mike Hoffman (19 goals) and Bobby Ryan (12 goals) after all three were injured over the weekend. Ryan will miss 4-to-6 weeks with a broken finger, while Stone (neck) and Hoffman (groin) are day to day. ""I think it's just our character that we stuck to the structure, everyone was on the same page,"" Anderson said. ""It doesn't take talent to play defense and play your position. Usually the talented guys are your offensive minded, and gifted skilled guys. As far as the guys we have in our lineup right now, there's still some skill there, but it starts with structure and taking care of the puck and frustrating the other team. "" The Senators have done that to the Devils all season. In sweeping their three-game series, Ottawa held New Jersey to two goals. ""Everybody stepped up; guys were just playing simple but making important plays that may not look like big plays at the time but we kept them from gaining momentum,"" said Kyle Turris, who scored for Ottawa along with defenseman Erik Karlsson. Turris played a game-high 26:09, while center Derick Brassard logged 20:06. ""Sometimes when you lose people that play a lot of minutes you know someone else is going to have to fill that spot,"" Karlsson said. ""I think tonight, we really embraced it and everyone here wanted to do that job. "" Travis Zajac scored for New Jersey and Cory Schneider made 21 saves. The Devils have lost two in a row, three of four and are six points out of a playoff spot. ""We're not in the best spot, but we have to keep finding a way to win games and compete and keep ourselves relevant in the race,"" Schneider said. ""Again, it is going to take a lot now, but we can't stop. "" Turris gave the Senators the lead 59 seconds into the second period after the Devils twice failed to get the puck out of their own end. The center fired the puck behind the New Jersey goal line, and Jean-Gabriel Pageauretrieved it and found Ryan Dzingel in the left circle. He sent a cross-ice pass to Turris for a shot into an open net for his 20th goal. Karlsson has points in six straight games after stretching the lead to 2-0 early in the third period with a power-play goal from the left circle. He beat a screened Schneider over the shoulder. With Tom Pyatt off for delay of game, Zajac got the Devils within a goal, putting a rebound of Joseph Blandisi's shot into an open net at 6:37. Anderson, whose wife Nicolle is battling throat cancer, was outstanding in the first two periods. He stopped deflections by Adam Henrique and Jacob Josefson in the first period and shots in close in each of the first two periods by Mike Cammalleri, who returned to the lineup after being benched for two games. He stopped a deflection by Zajac in close in the final minute. NOTES: The Devils activated D Kyle Quincey (upper body) off injured reserve after he missed six games. D John Moore was a healthy scratch. ... The Senators called up Fs Max McCormick and Casey Bailey from Binghamton (AHL) to replace Hoffman and Stone. ... New Jersey F Beau Bennett was a healthy scratch. ... Devils F Pavel Zacha did not return for the third period with an upper-body injury. UP NEXT Senators: Play the second of a four-game road trip at Carolina on Friday night. Devils: Host the cross-river rival Rangers on Saturday.  ",nkb,Sens down Devils 2-1,"As you may have heard, several of the Ottawa Senatorsê key players missed tonightês tilt against the New Jersey Devils due to injury. Mark Stone, Bobby Ryan, and Mike Hoffmanwere all unable to suit up for the visitors. Chris Neil returned to the line-up, and Casey Baileyand Max McCormick were recalled to bolster the fourth line. On the TSN broadcast they flashed a graphic showing that of the six forwards projected to be on Ottawaês top two lines at the start of the year, only two were available tonight. In short: for the Sens to win, someone would need to step up. Someone like say, oh, maybe Craig Anderson? Or perhaps Erik Karlsson? What about Kyle Turris? The first period mostly consisted of the type of uneventful, neutral zone-heavy game weêve come to expect from a match-up between these two squads. Truthfully, low-event hockey was probably exactly what Ottawa was aiming for considering their lack of offensive firepower on the evening. It was just over eight minutes into the game before the Devils even had their first shot, but by the end of the frame the shots were 10 a piece and Craig Anderson had made a couple of five star saves. This would be a recurring theme throughout the evening. Less than a minute into the second, Kyle Turris broke the scoreless tie off a beauty of a feed from Ryan Dzingel. The goal wouldnêt have been possible, however, had it not been for Jean-Gabriel Pageauês strong work to retrieve a loose puck and find Dzingel in the first place. Pageau hasnêt been as productive offensively this season as last, but heês quietly on pace for 30 points despite a heavy defensive deployment. The rest of the second frame was a lot of Craig Anderson and the occasional chance from the Turris line. The Sens were never going to generate much offensively without their best wingers, but whenever Turris was on the ice they were at least a threat. After two, the shots were 20-19 in favour of the Devils and the score was still 1-0. Ottawa was 19-2-1 when leading after two periods before tonightês game, but you got the feeling that protecting this lead might be particularly white-knuckled. Thankfully, Karlsson found the back of the net on a beauty of a shot shortly after New Jersey took a Too Many Men penalty. My mere words wonêt do the shot justice: Besides the goal, Karlsson was a force to be reckoned with on this evening. He made several sharp defensive plays, and the Sens won the 5v5 shot attempt battle 21-17 when he was on the ice tonight. To put that in context, attempts were 47-13 for the Devils when was not.  After Karlssonês goal, the Sens went into a shell the likes of which we hadnêt seen in weeks. Itês been a trademark of Guy Boucherês teams to sit back on leads in the third, mostly successfully, but tonight it felt like they didnêt have any choice. Without any of their top wingers to drive sustained offensive pressure, the third period was one long chip it out and change. A Travis Zajac power-play goal, made things even more uncomfortable down the stretch but Anderson was up to the task and the Devils couldnêt find the equalizer despite nearly ten minutes of almost uninterrupted pressure.  The importance of how a team wins a game has been the source of heated debate in the hockey world for the last 15 years or so. The introduction of shot metrics such as Corsi and Expected Goals (xG) have driven these discussions. Mostly I side with the numbers: a _goodÓ win is better than a _badÓ win. Tonight, though, given the Senatorsê situation, youêll take the win and run. Tonight, two points is two points. Sens Honourable Mention: Kyle Turris Turris scored the opening goal and generated a substantial amount of the teamês offense. Turris was without his usual complement of scoring wingers, but he made it work nonetheless. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson For Ottawa to win tonight, we all knew Anderson would have to be excellent. He was just that. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson Sometimes there arenêt enough superlatives to describe the captainês play, but tonight really was one of his performances of the season considering the circumstances.  ",All About the Jersey,"Devils swept by Senators, fall 2-1.","Although the similarities were evident, almost terrifyingly so, the gameplay was not the same as the prior Ottawa game.  Turris and Karlsson scored again for the Devils, and the only Senators penalty was another delay of game. Ottawa was up 1-0 entering the third again, and played a solid defensive game yet again. Ottawa won. However, thatês where the similarities end.  Personally, I thought the Devils played pretty well. They got 30 shots on net, but attempted to take a lot more shots. They only allowed 23 shots on goal, though that may be due to the Senators choosing to hold back. This game had more energy than the last Senators game though, and the Devils only had one really bad breakdown which led to a goal, while Karlsson scored because heês Erik Karlsson. According to Corsi stats, every Devils player was positive except Zacha and Parenteau. Unlike the other Senators game, multiple Devils showed up and played well, but the Senators defense and Craig Anderson was incredible. The first period was scoreless, but more on the Senators side. Unlike the first Senators game, the Devils actually played with energy. Joseph Blandisi and Miles Wood were everywhere, throwing the body around and continuing to shoot.  The second featured an Ottawa goal one minute into the game, which again coincides with my statement that the Devils donêt start periods well. Kyle Turris scored off some sick passing by the Senators. Riley Dzingel and Jean-Gabriel Pageau made the assists that led to the goal, and it was a 1-0 lead. Blandisi had a chance to tie the game, but shanked the shot. Sadly, Pavel Zacha got injured in this period as well. He did not come back to the game. To end the period, Cammalleri had a glorious chance in front, but sadly could not put the puck in to end his extended drought. Overall, the Devils couldêve gotten more chances in the second period, but it was an improvement.  The third was all Devils... except for the fact that the Devils took a too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty. Those penalties are the kind that the Devils canêt afford to take, and Erik Karlsson made the Devils pay. His shot was perfect, right over Schneider and in, and it was 2-0. The Devils continued applying pressure, and got lucky when Tommy Wingels lifted a puck over the glass. Zajac got robbed on his first chance in the powerplay, but was able to stuff one in off a Joseph Blandisi pass later in the power play. After this, the Devils put shot after shot, but the Senators defense would not be penetrated, and the score ended 2-1.  This game didnêt disappoint me -- the Devils actually played well. However, in the NHL, the better team doesnêt always win. In this game, the Devils were the better team for the majority of it.  Sadly for some fans, this might signal that the season is over. With this loss, the Devils may find it too difficult to catch up to the other NHL teams, and start selling now. But, weêll see soon.  The NHL Game Stats: The NHL Game Summary | The NHL Event Summary | The NHL Play-By-Play | The NHL Shot Summary | The Natural Stat Trick | HockeyStats.Ca Who Played Well? Many Devils played well today, which is an unusual thing. Miles Wood used his speed to cause mayhem in the Senators zone, with one particular instant where he caused Dion Phaneuf to fall down trying to chase him. Joseph Blandisi and Jacob Josefson were everywhere, which surprises me a bit. Stefan Noesen was a +14 on the night, which was the highest for the Devils. Heês been quiet of late, and itês unknown what role heêll play for the Devils in the future. Severson put up four shots, and Merrill put up three shots, with Severson the highest rated player according to Corsi.  Itês not usual for Devils players to have positive corsi ratings, so itês a shame that they lost. This may be skewed due to the fact that the Senators completely held back after the first goal, and also the fact that the Senators lost a ton of star forwards to injury. In the end, the Devils couldnêt overcome the defense, but it is what it is.  Blocks Galore: The Senators blocked 22 Devils shots tonight, which is a major reason why the Devils were unable to score. With a two-on-one featuring Palmieri, Dion Phaneuf stuck his stick out and prevented an invaluable Devils scoring chance. Shots from the points rarely made it to Anderson, with players like Borowiecki, Phaneuf and Karlsson consistently throwing their bodies in the way. Accuracy was also an issue for the Devils, with Taylor Hall missing four shots, and only getting one on target.  Who Burned Us?: Last game, I highlighted Dzingel, Stone and Hoffman. Today, Stone and Hoffman didnêt play at all, which required other Senators to step up. While not as strong as the previous game, Dzingel and Pageau teamed up well, and caused the Devils trouble before the Senators resigned to all-out defense. Their passing and speed helped lead directly to Turrisê goal, his 20th of the year.  On defense, Erik Karlsson is a star, and showed it tonight. His goal was an incredible shot, and he had himself a solid defensive night as well. Mark Borowiecki played a physical game today. He fought Wood, and delivered seven hits on the Devils tonight. The long-time Senator can be counted on to provide no offensive value, whilst providing steady defense and 100+ penalty minutes a season. He outmuscled the Devils tonight, and his name was called quite a few times.  So What Now?: Does this loss mean itês time to sell? If so, it looks like goodbye to Kyle Quincey and PA Parenteau. The value of those two is unknown, considering the meager return for Michael Stone, who provides more value than either of the two. NJ.com recently wrote an article talking about how Kyle Quincey could be a match fit for the Penguins, which makes sense considering that the Penguins love obtaining depth defenseman. PA Parenteau could go to any contender and act as a depth piece.  Regardless, Michael Stone going for only a third round pick surprises me. While a UFA in the midst of a bad season, heês still only 26 and a year removed from a 36 point season. Quincey and Parenteau are rated less in my eyes, so weêll see what they could be valued at.  Smith-Pelly Role: Smith-Pelly has developed into a player with a role for this Devils team, after being scratched for a long string of games. Now, heês developed into a reliable defensive player, and a solid fourth liner. He had four hits this game, and set up Wood with passes throughout the game. While he likely will serve no role for the Devils beyond this year, heês good to keep as he acts as a body the Devils can expose for the Expansion Draft. Schneider: Iêve said this many times, but itês good to see Schneider back. Kinkaid had himself an unusually bad night on Sunday, considering his solid performance on the season. Schneider now finds himself 19-18-8, with a .914 save percentage. On paper, this looks below-average, but heês been incredible if you account his horrendous early-season play. Heês had an amazing .936 save percentage in February, with it being an even better .940 in the last five games. However, at the age of 30, the Devils have to decide whether or not they are going to waste Schneiderês best years.  "

He made the most of a rare chance to play against the Ottawa Senators. Lack, making his sixth start of the season, stopped 34 shots for his ninth career shutout to lead the Hurricanes to a 3-0 victory over the Senators on Friday night. Jordan Staal, Elias Lindholm and Viktor Stalberg scored, and Phillip Di Giuseppe had two assists to help Carolina snap a five-game losing streak (0-4-1) and move out of last place in the Eastern Conference. ""I thought the guys were aggressive attacking the net,"" Carolina coach Bill Peters said. ""We haven't had a chance to play (Lack) much due to his injuries and everything else. We've got to get him going. I thought he did a great job here tonight and took advantage of his opportunity. "" The Hurricanes set the tone by getting a quick goal from Staal and outshooting the visitors 19-7 in the first period. ""I felt like we were controlling from the start,"" said Lack (2-3-1), who got his first win in four tries against Ottawa. ""Like 10 or 12 shots the first eight minutes. The boys came out flying and I just had to be big when I had to. It was a good night for us. "" Craig Anderson finished with 41 saves for Ottawa, which snapped a three-game road winning streak. The Senators squandered a chance to move into first place in the Atlantic Division. ""(Carolina) came out really hard and we were really expecting that, so there's no excuse,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said. ""There's no reason we shouldn't be ready for their surge in the first period, and we were just not there. We were just not good at all. "" Ottawa captain Erik Karlsson moved past Kyle Turris into sole possession of second place on the franchise's consecutive games played list with 308. Ottawa had won the teams' first two meetings this season at home, 2-1 in overtime on Nov. 1 and 2-1 on Nov. 26. Staal put Carolina ahead just 1:19 into the contest, skating from the left corner for a wraparound shot past Anderson for his 12th of the season. ""(Di Giuseppe) and (Brock McGinn) are both hard-working guys who skate really well and can create plays when they had the opportunity,"" Staal said. ""We've been talking about getting to the net more. We've been creating a lot of good looks from the outside, but there are a lot of `grease' goals around the league just around the net, and I thought we did a better job crashing a little bit more. "" Ottawa outshot the Hurricanes 17-14 in the second, but gave up two more goals. Lindholm made it 2-0 with 4:44 remaining in the middle period as he took a pass across the crease from Di Giuseppe and beat Anderson stick side. It went to 3-0 with 42 secons left when Stalberg followed Sebastian Aho's shot from the left circle and beat Anderson stick side. Victor Rask had the secondary assist, getting his 20th of the season and breaking a 14-game scoreless streak. NOTES: The Hurricanes are 18-8-2 at home this season. ... This was just the second time in eight seasons that Ottawa won the season series against Carolina. ... Ottawa C Mike Hoffman (groin) and RW Mark Stone (neck) each missed his second straight game while D Fredrik Claesson was a healthy scratch. ... C Derek Ryan and D Matt Tennyson were healthy scratches for Carolina. UP NEXT Senators: At Florida on Sunday in the third game of a four-game road trip. Hurricanes: Host Calgary on Sunday in the finale of their five-game homestand.  ",Callum Fraser,Injury-Depleted Senators Fall 3-0 to Hurricanes,"During the midst of an abundance of trade talk and movement throughout the entire league, the Ottawa Senators had an opportunity to move into first place in the Atlantic Division with a win over the Carolina Hurricanes. The Montreal Canadiens had held the top spot in the division since the first game of the 2016-17 campaign. While Carey Price is struggling to find his game and the rest of the team attempts to find their way with a brand new head coach in Claude Julien, the Senators were in a prime position to take advantage of their rivalês misfortune. With a two-day rest and playing a team at the bottom of the Eastern Conference, it was promising that Ottawa could turn in a better performance in Raleigh. The first 20 minutes disagreed, though. Early on, Cody Ceci and Dion Phaneuf showed why the pair is a combined minus-16 on the year with a horrifying shift in the defensive zone. Ceci got bodied by Jordan Staal, who then easily made his way past Phaneuf for a brutal wraparound goal on Craig Anderson. The good news? Anderson was phenomenal for the rest of the period. The bad news? He absolutely had to be or else this game wouldêve been more out of reach than a playoff spot for the Colorado Avalanche. It was painfully obvious the team had lost their identity with the loss of Mark Stone, Mike Hoffman or Bobby Ryan (understandably so). After getting slapped around by the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night only to come away with a miraculous regulation win, the Senators looked to be in for another game theyêd have to hope for a couple of lucky breaks to garner a point from.  At the end of the first frame, the Hurricanes led in shot attempts 34-13 and shots 19-7. The Senators set out on a mission in the second period: to get more than three scoring chances.  After Zack Smith took a tripping penalty, ending what felt like the silent treatment from the referees through 28 minutes of play and numerous missed calls, Tom Pyatt made his was past two Hurricanes defenders and was in all alone on Eddie Lack. Pyatt deked to the left and attempted to slide it past the goaltenderês toe, but Lack proved to be just a tad too flexible. The Senators would push the play a lot more after the intermission, but that didnêt stop Carolina from extending their lead. Twice. Canes forward Elias Lindholm took advantage of a dazed and confused Curtis Lazar when he found himself completely unmarked at the bottom of the right circle. Di Giuseppe (fantastic hockey name) quickly threw a pass across the crease and Anderson had no chance at the following one-timer. In the final minute, the home team would strike again. After a failed clearing attempt that hit off Marc Methotês shin pad, the Hurricanes put together a swift counter attack. A trailing Viktor Stalberg pounced on a ricochet off Erik Karlsson and fired home the rebound into a wide open cage. Ottawa went back to the dressing room down 3-0 and searching for a way to create some consistent offensive pressure. The Senators would get their opportunities in the final frame. Twice they were awarded a power play, but twice it was the Hurricaneês league leading penalty kill that came out on top.  Ottawa failed to take advantage of a team that is an outright seller as the trade deadline approaches and were extremely unsuccessful against a goaltender with a save percentage of 85.6. Lack walked away with only his second win of the season, his last one coming on October 20, 2016. If youêre a Senators fan, that wasnêt fun to watch. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson 41 saves on a night where there werenêt many moments of sustained offensive zone pressure for the visiting team made for quite the busy night for Anderson. The 35-year-old may not have had the chance to be a game changer in this one, but it very likely couldêve been 6-0 or 7-0 without the Senatorsê No. 1 in net. Sens Zero: Curtis Lazar Oh, Curtis. Hereês a guy the entirety of the fanbase sincerely hopes gets his game back on track. Sitting at a single point on the season, he hasnêt done much to make the coaching staff believe he can handle anything higher than 9 minutes a night. Itês hard to believe Senators general manager Pierre Dorion wouldnêt take a second or a third-round pick in exchange for the 22-year-old once the pressure of March 1 begins creeping in on deadline day. Lazarês value is sinking with every game he fails to make his way on the scoresheet. Sens Killer: Hurricanes Forward Corps Carolina completely toyed with Ottawa during the first period. The Canesê forward group showed an outstanding combination of skill and chemistry. They refused to allow the Senators to break out and when they rarely were pushed back to the neutral zone or defensive end, it was an all around effort to retrieve the puck and begin another attack. Jeff Skinner, Sebastian Aho, Jordan Staal and Elias Lidholm, among others, represent a darn decent forward corps in Carolina. Definitely one of the reasons analysts and odds makers continue to label them as a legitimate playoff contender. It might be a little too late for the Canes, but theyêve shown a lot of good things the past month-or-so.  ",Canes Country,Hurricanes Finally Rebound; Blank Senators 3-0,"After a damaging five-game losing streak, the Carolina Hurricanes provided their home fans with something to cheer about on Friday.  Behind a stellar effort from netminder Eddie Lack, the Canes shut down the Ottawa Senators3-0. Perhaps this will lead to a longer stretch of play for Lack, who had only one previous start since his return from a concussion. For a team that needs to go on a serious tear just to get back into any semblance of contention, a hot goaltender is an absolute must.                                          Fast Start Provides All The Scoring Needed Something that the Hurricanes have failed to do recently is provide themselves with a fast start, at least in terms of putting goals on the board. Last night was a welcome change of pace. Just over one minute into the contest, Jordan Staal powered his way around the net onto his forehand side and buried a wraparound goal which proved to be all the Canesê needed on this night. The Canesê continued to control play throughout the first period, but could not break through with another goal. After out-shooting the Senators 19-7 in the first, the Canes were finally able to assume complete control of the game in the second period.  Lack and the Offensive Attack After a premium stop from Lack early in the period against Chris Wideman, the Hurricanes added the insurance goals that would help salt away this game. Following some extended puck possession in the second period, Canesê provided a second tally, this time from Elias Lindholm, as the Canes won an offensive zone faceoff and worked the puck around the boards to Staal, whose centering feed was deflected straight to Phil Di Giuseppe who then passed to Lindholm across the crease for a grade-A look.   Minutes later, the Hurricanes pulled away further from the Senators with a goal from Victor Stalberg that was created after a turnover caused by the tremendous effort from Sebastian Aho and Victor Rask.   For Rask, the assist broke a 14-game pointless streak. For the team and Rask, you can only hope that this is a springboard for the final 20-plus games, as his struggles have seemed to mirror the team's offensive woes.  For the remainder of the contest, the Hurricanes continued to pile up shots and control the play. Both teams came away with hefty shot numbers, as the Canesê piled on 44 total shots at Craig Anderson. The Senators rang up 34 of their own, but Lack met each challenge.  One of the more intriguing aspects of last nightês game, and likely the games going forward the rest of the season, was the new defensive pairings. With the trade of veteran Ron Hainsey to the Penguins, the Hurricanes placed Jaccob Slavin and Justin Faulk together, and elevated Noah Hanifin onto a pairing with Brett Pesce. These combinations could be together for an extended period of time, not just this season but for years, barring a future trade of one of these defenseman for more offensive punch. Even if the Canes are not to leap back into the playoff race, watching these pairing grow and hopefully develop will be a huge part of the final six weeks of this season.                                           For the Hurricanes, this win was much needed, but it only serves as a band-aid on a gunshot wound at this time. Continuing this success into Sunday against the Calgary Flames, 3 pm at PNC Arena, is an absolute must. While there are still games in hand, and a somewhat favorable schedule ahead, including a home and home with the Arizona Coyotes as well as another crack at the NHL-worst Colorado Avalanche, the Hurricanes must go on an extended win streak just to get back into contention. Last night was a good start on that long climb up the mountain; now they must begin to replicate that performance.  "

Kyle Turris scored the tiebreaking goal in the second period and Anderson stopped 37 shots to lift the Ottawa Senators over the Florida Panthers 2-1 on Sunday night. Anderson played for the Panthers from 2006-09 and is 14-7-2 against them. ""This has always been kind of home for me. It's a little more emotional for me when I play here,"" he said. ""You seem to get up for those types of games when you have friends and family in the stands. "" Anderson was coming off a 3-0 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday. ""You just have to get back on that horse and start riding it again,"" he said. ""If you have a bad memory I think it works to your benefit. "" Zack Smith scored an early short-handed goal for the Senators, who have won four of six. Erik Karlsson had two assists. Anderson was out from Dec. 7 until Feb. 11, a span of 26 games. ""Andy is an outstanding No. 1 goalie,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said. ""We missed him for a long time. You saw what a difference his experience made tonight. "" Jonathan Marchessault scored for Florida, and James Reimer made 31 saves. The Panthers have lost three straight after sweeping a five-game road trip, and dropped their last four home games overall. The Panthers, fifth in the Atlantic Division, trail the second-place Senators by six points and missed a chance to gain ground. ""This was a four-point game right here,"" Marchessault said. Turris put Ottawa ahead when his wrist shot went over Reimer's glove at 9:58 of the second for his 21st goal of the season. ""We're right in the race with Ottawa right now,"" Florida center Aleksander Barkov said. ""We need to win these close games. We played well but that's not enough. "" The Senators took a 1-0 lead on the short-handed goal by Smith. Reimer blocked a shot from Karlsson, but Smith grabbed the rebound and poked in the puck at 6:28 of the first. Smith has 12 career short-handed goals. ""It was just a great play off the pass. It was right on my stick,"" Smith said. ""It was nice to get one short-handed and get a little momentum. "" Marchessault tied it on his power-play goal with 2:47 left in the first. He took a feed from Jonathan Huberdeau in the left circle and put the puck high into the net.

Senators forwards Mark Stone, who leads the team with 22 goals, and Mike Hoffman returned to the lineup. ... Phil Varone and Michael Blunden were recalled from Binghamton of the AHL. UP NEXT Senators: Visit the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday. Panthers: Host the Carolina Panthers on Tuesday.  ",Colin4000,Sens hold off Panthers for 2-1 win,"The Ottawa Senators and Florida Panthers met for the fourth time this season, with Florida taking two of the previous three meetings.  With the Atlantic division as tight as it is, every divisional game is a battle for the playoffs. Coming into tonight, the Panthers sat four points back of the Senators with one more game played, although they were red hot having gone 8-3-0 in their last eleven games. A massive part of the surge has to do with the return of young studs Jonathan Huberdeau and Aleksander Barkov, who combined have a P/GP of 1.06 since their returns.  Ottawa had two key returnees of their own tonight, as Mark Stone and Mike Hoffman were both on the ice to start the game after suffering injuries in last weekês contest versus Winnipeg. Mike Blunden and Fredrik Claesson were healthy scratches (Claessonês third healthy scratch in a row), and Curtis Lazar was out with an upper-body injury. It was a scrappy game for both teams, with Mark Borowiecki dropping the gloves two minutes into the first period with Shawn Thornton. A few minutes later during a Chris Neil minor penalty, Ottawa would strike first off a shorthanded rush from Zack Smith and Erik Karlsson. The captain showed off his speed by creating a two-on-one the other way and taking a shot, which went right to Smith for the rebound. It was Smithês team-leading third shorthanded goal of the season and Ottawaês sixth.  The scrappiness continued later into the period, with Thornton dropping the gloves again, this time with Dion Phaneuf. Thornton received a misconduct on the play, although Ottawa couldnêt muster anything on the ensuing power play.  The Panthers later went to the man advantage, where some slick passing led to wide open net for Jonathan Marchessault to tie the game late in the period. Both teams headed into the locker room dead even, with the shots also tied 9-9. Early in the the second frame, both teams would get an even amount of chances. Kyle Turriswould break the tie halfway through, sending a shot top shelf past James Reimer on the short side.  The highlight of the period, however, would come just a few minutes later. Reilly Smithappeared to have an open net in close, although a half-fanned shot combined with incredible athleticism from Craig Anderson kept the puck out. Anderson only seems to be getting younger, having himself another incredible game at a crucial time. Both teams were deadlocked throughout the third period, with neither team being able to muster the next goal. Shawn Thornton dropped the gloves for a third time, this time opposing Chris Neil. The Sens got to the man advantage midway through with a chance to extend their lead, although the power play continued to lack pace as the game remained 2-1. Hoffman took an interference penalty against Vincent Trocheck with six minutes left, although the penalty kill was able to successfully shut the Panthers down.  Mark Stone nearly scored his 23rd of the season after poking one in from underneath Reimer, except the referee had already blown the whistle. The call made sense from the officialês perspective, as it appeared Reimer had already covered the puck. Either way, the game remained 2-1 Sens heading into the final stretch. You wonêt believe what happened next: another fight! Unexpectedly dropping the gloves were Ryan Dzingel and Reilly Smith (the battle of the #18s), who each recording their second career fights. It was just that kind of game. James Reimer got pulled in the final minute, and although the Panthers would apply more pressure, The System would come through and hang on for the victory. The win moves Ottawa back within two points of Montreal for the Atlantic division lead, and a win tomorrow could bring us to the top. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson The captain recorded an assist on each of Ottawaês two goals, moving him within one assist of Nicklas Backstrom for second in the league. He was all over the ice tonight making offensive and defensive plays, and was a key component to pulling away with tonightês victory. On a side note, Karlsson played only 12:46 tonight at 5v5, his lowest total of the season. That was fourth amongst Sens defensemen, and a whole four minutes less than team-leading Dion Phaneuf. Whatês up with that, Boucher? Honourable Mention: Craig Anderson Thereês just something about Anderson that makes you feel secure whenever heês in net. He allowed only one goal while facing 37 shots, and has only had a save percentage below .900 once since returning from leave. He made many great stops that couldêve resulted in goals for Florida, bailing out some at times porous defence. It was full beast mode tonight for Andy. Sens Killer: Jonathan Marchessault Scoring Floridaês lone goal tonight, Marchessault has now scored in three of the Sensê four meetings with the Panthers this season. Now one away from 20 goals, watch out for him in the future.   ",Litter Box Cats,Panthers home woes continue with 2-1 loss to Senators,"The Florida Panthers tightened up defensively, for the most part, but could only dent the twine once in a 2-1 loss to the Ottawa Senators on Sunday night at the BB&T Center. With the win, Ottawa remained in second place in the Atlantic Division, just two points behind first place Montreal with two games in the hand. Florida is now three points behind Toronto, which holds the second wild card, with each team having 21 games remaining. The Senators opened the scoring with a shorthanded goal 6:28 into the action, thanks to wheels of Erik Karlsson. Karlsson collected a loose puck in his own end and used his speed to create a 2-on-1 break. James Reimer made a nice save on the defenseman, but the rebound came right to Zack Smith who easily buried it. The Panthers got another man-advantage chance later in the period and got it right this time. Jonathan Marchessault bagged his nineteenth at the 17:13 mark after Jonathan Huberdeauês cross-ice feed rendered Ottawa keeper Craig Anderson helpless. Keith Yandle drew the second assist on the pretty, pretty passing play. Kyle Turris scored the go-ahead goal 9:58 into the middle frame after a short head-man pass from Mike Hoffman allowed him to move in on Reimer and roof the puck. Karlsson started the play off with a bullet pass from his own end to Hoffman at the blue line. Anderson finished the game with 37 saves to deny his old team, who couldnêt come up with a goal over the final forty minutes, just the game prior against Calgary. The goaltenderês best stop came just over a minute after Turrisê goal, when snake-bitten Reilly Smith was forced to smell the glove after Anderson robbed him of what looked a sure score. The Panthers finish off what has turned into a house of horrors homestand against the reeling Carolina Hurricanes, who have lost six of their last seven, on Tuesday. Florida needs to right the ship and snap its three-game losing streak before heading off to Philadelphia for a one-off roadie. Law & Order Florida latest defeat, their fourth in a row at the BB&T Center, dropped their home record to 14-13-3. Not sure what the problem is, but If the Cats want to make the playoffs they simply must start winning at home. Zack Smithês goal was his third shorthanded marker of the season, tying him with six other players for the league-lead. James Reimer made 31 stops in a hard-luck quality start. With Roberto Luongo struggling as of late, Reimer needs to see more action going forward. Jonathan Huberdeauês beautiful set up on Jonathan Marchesaultês goal gave him 10 points in 10 games since returning to the lineup. Speaking of Marchessault, he has scored a goal in three of Florida last four games. The 26-year-old led his club with six shots on goal. Kyle Turris paced the Senators with six shots and his game-winner was his fifth of the year in that department.

Kucherov scored three power-play goals in the second period and the Tampa Bay Lightning kept their fading playoff hopes alive with a 5-1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Monday night. Kucherov had the second hat trick of his career and added an assist in the third period. Jonathan Drouin assisted all three of his goals and Victor Hedman assisted on two. A day after trading goaltender Ben Bishop to Los Angeles and just hours after trading forward Brian Boyle to Toronto, the Lightning improved to 6-1-2 over their past nine games. ""Everybody understands (the trade deadline) is just part of the season,"" Kucherov said. ""Sometimes you go through it, but we have to continue to play the game. We have a general manger to take care of that stuff. Our job is just to play hockey. "" The Senators, who won at Florida on Sunday night, are 6-6 over their past 12 games. Ottawa scored with a two-man advantage just 6:26 into the game, Kyle Turris converting his 22nd goal of the season with assists from Erik Karlssonand Mike Hoffman. ""We had chances but our power plays have been terrible the last four or five games,"" Senators forward Mark Stone said. ""It hasn't created us any momentum, it hasn't gotten us very much. Nice to get one on the 5-on-3, but you're supposed to score on those. "" Playing in his first game as a No. 1 goalie in the wake of the Bishop trade, Andrei Vasilevskiy survived a rough start to end a five-game losing streak (0-2-3). ""I was a little disappointed with how we came out,"" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. ""I don't know if the events of today hurt our mindset or what happened, but Vasilevskiy was outstanding. "" Brayden Point tied it for the Lightning with an unassisted goal early in the second period. The game changed abruptly at 5:16 when Ottawa's Mark Borowiecki and Tampa Bay's Braydon Coburn drew five-minute fighting penalties and the Senators' Tom Pyatt was called for hooking. Kucherov scored his first goal of the game just 21 seconds later, marking the third straight game in which he has scored. He made it 3-1 at 10:26 of the period, and 4-1 with his 26th goal of the season with just 13.5 seconds remaining in the period. Coburn scored the Lightning's final goal midway through the third period. ""We're trying to get in (the playoffs),"" Cooper said. ""You've got to beat the teams that are ahead of you. Those are""four-point games"", and this was one of them tonight. "" NOTES: The Senators acquired forward Alex Burrows from Vancouver for prospect Jonathan Dahlen, the 42nd pick in the 2016 draft. ... Steven Stamkos, who had right knee surgery in November, took part in the Lightning's morning skate and the team is hopeful he might return this season. ... Tests revealed a torn labrum for Ottawa goaltender Andrew Hammond, who is expected to have season-ending surgery next week. ... Tampa Bay got forward Byron Froese and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Maple Leafs for Boyle. Froese, 25, will be assigned to AHL Syracuse. UP NEXT Senators: Host Colorado on Thursday night in the first of three straight home games. Lightning: Will conclude a four-game homestand Wednesday night against Carolina.  ",Ross A,Sens collapse in 5-1 loss to Bolts,"Youêd be forgiven if you forgot which team had played the night before. The Senators jumped out to an early 11-4 advantage on shots. They would eventually edge the Lightning out 15-8 in shots. The Sens scored the only goal of the period, a beautiful powerplay snipe by Kyle Turrisafter some good quick puck movement by the unit. It was really what the Sens needed, knowing their legs would probably give out first when playing a team with two more days off than them. There was a scary moment near the end when Ryan Dzingel was slow getting up, but he would be OK and the Sens would get a powerplay to finish off the period. The second period saw things fall apart a little bit. The Sens would have a moment of fear with Kyle Turris going head-first into the boards and being slow to get up, but just Dzingel in the first, Turris would return. Then Brayden Point would pick off an errant Zack Smith pass after Mike Condon flubbed the pass behind the net. Point would pick the top corner past a helpless Condon, tying the game up. Then a second period penalty for hooking to Tom Pyatt set up the Bolts to score a goal, a one-time shot by Nikita Kucherov. Suddenly a game the Sens had been dominating had them behind on the scoreboard. The on the next Sens penalty, tripping on Dion Phaneuf, Kucherov would again rip home a one-timer. Heês a lethal goal scorer, and it was a little sad to see the Sensê PK leave him wide-open two powerplays in a row. Ottawa seemed to be fading as the second went on, trying to just get to the intermission. But just when you thought theyêd succeed, Kucherov completed the natural hat trick with (you guessed it) a one-timer from the right faceoff circle on the powerplay. It felt a bit like watching highlight of Alex Ovechkin on the powerplay - you wonder why nobody ever thinks to cover him. Though Ottawa held a 26-25 advantage in shots through two periods, the Bolts had a 4-1 advantage where it mattered. After a furious second period, the third felt a little slow. Donêt get me wrong, there were chances (including another Kucherov one-timer) but it was nothing compared to the second. Maybe it was the lack of penalties, maybe it was the lack of scrums, but either way the Sens almost seemed resigned to their fate that they were going to lose this game. Finally, after Kucherov tried a couple times to snap home his fourth, Brayden Coburn got the puck at the point and put it in off a Senator stick and over Condonês glove. At 5-1, the game seemed very out of hand. Then an ugly trip by Cedric Paquette on Tommy Wingels left the second-newest Senator on the ice. It was the third injury scare of the game, but for the third time the player would get up and play his next shift. It also led to a lot of penalties, which eventually ended up in the Sens earning a powerplay. They would then have an awful, mediocre powerplay, the kind youêd expect to see from the team up by three goals just killing the clock. And the game would end with the Sens somehow collecting 40 shots even though it felt like theyêd been out of it since five minutes into the second. Letês hope the team picks themselves up by Thursday. Honourable Mention: Mark Stone No one gets a hero nod in a lop-sided loss, but Stone was the best Senator on the night. Hardly surprising since it was Game 61 on the schedule. Sens Zero: Penalty Kill How do you allow three goals to the same person from the same spot? By having a terrible night, thatês how. Sens Killer: Nikita Kucherov One of the best young players in the league, and it was on full display tonight. What a lethal shot.  ",Raw Charge,Nikita Kucherov powers Lightning to 5-1 win over Senators,"From the moment Ben Bishop was traded to the Los Angeles Kings, Andrei Vasilevskiy was going to be in the spotlight the moment the puck dropped on Monday nightês game against the Ottawa Senators. His fellow Russian, Nikita Kucherov, took that spotlight and one-timed it into the net as the Lightning beat the Ottawa Senators, 5-1, at Amalie Arena. Kucherov kept his recent hot streak going as he had a four-point night against the Senators that included a natural hat trick in the second period. All three of his goals came on the power play as the Lightning used their special teams to take down the Senators and pick up two points in the standings. With Peter Budaj on the bench wearing number 31 and sporting a glorious mountain-man beard looking on instead of his good friend and hugging buddy Ben Bishop, Vasilevskiy made 39 saves in the win, ending a five-game personal losing streak. The only other lineup change was Adam Erne replacing Brian Boyle on Vlad Namestnikovês line. Recently signed Greg McKegg and call-up Yanni Gourde were healthy scratches. First Period Jonathan Drouin returned to the lineup as well, after missing the game against Calgary with the flu. He showed why he is so important to the Lightning offense as he had a great chance in front of the net that Mike Condon stopped. The Triplets were generating chances as well, as Tyler Johnson se Kucherov up for a one-timer that Condon scrambled to stop. It was the Lightningês inability to get the puck out of the zone that led to the first Ottawa goal. Vasilevskiy stayed in the net as a deflected puck tricked deep into the Lightning zone. They werenêt able to control it, and Kucherov ended up tripping a Senator. Forty-seven seconds later Brayden Coburn tapped Zack Smith in the face with his stick and the Senators had a 5-on-3. Kyle Turris snuck a one-timer past Vasilevskiy and Ottawa had the early lead.  With the Lightning still a little on their heels from the penalty kill, the Senators almost doubled their lead. Cody Ceci had the initial shot that the Lightning goaltender blockered right to Chris Kelly. Kelly fired it toward the empty net only to see a certain goal swallowed up by the right leg pad of a fully stretched-out Vasilevskiy. The Lightning must have felt the fans in Section 128 deserved to see more of the game as they spent much of the first half of the period pinned back in their defensive zone. Outshot 13-4 in the first half of the game, Vasilevskiy had to be on his game. The Senators spent 10 minutes shredding the Lightning in the neutral zone and setting up quality scoring chances. Tampa Bay managed to tilt the ice back to even slightly, an excellent slap pass from Victor Hedman found Kucherov wide open in the right circle, but the Lightningês leading scorer hooked the shot wide of the net. Erne had a clean shot from the point that forced Condon to make a nice save.  Second Period Perhaps the Senators wore themselves out in the first period   after all they had played the night before in Sunrise. Whatever happened to them between periods, Tampa clearly was the faster team in the second. An they used their speed to quickly turn a deficit to a lead. The first goal came from Drouin racing down the ice to create havoc behind the net. He rushed Condon into making a bad pass, then old-man Alex Killorn forced the Senator defender to pass it to the middle of the ice where it found Point. The rookie calmly wristed it over Condon for the game-tying goal. After Ottawa picked up an extra penalty in a skirmish between Coburn and Mark Borowiecki, the Lightning attacked the Senatorsê zone with speed. After a smooth entry into the zone, Drouin dropped a no-look pass to Hedman, who guided the puck across the ice to Kucherov and the Russian did not hook this one-timer wide as he snapped it past Condon for his 24th goal of the season. That play worked so well, the Lightning gave it another go. This time it was Drouin sliding the puck through a seam to Kucherov and his one-timer once again found the back of the net. Not only were the Lightning scoring on the 8th-best penalty kill in the league, they were dominating it by keeping the puck in the zone for long stretches of time. Kucherov capped off the natural hat trick with Zach Smith in the penalty box after a dubious roughing call. Drouin carried the puck down low, passed it to Hedman who passed it cross-ice to Kucherov. The puck was on a platter for the Kucherov one-timer and he blasted it over Condonês shoulder. At this point, the Lightning power play was basically Bo Jackson in Tecmo Bowl. Everyone on the ice knes what play was coming yet they are powerless to stop it. Third Period The Lightning needed to play strong for 20 more minutes to finish off the game and pick up some ground in the playoff race. They had to walk the fine line between playing smart and not retreating into a shell. With the three-goal lead, Jon Cooper had the benefit of being able to roll all four of his lines and keep their shifts short. They didnêt sit back. Kucherov came close to picking up his fourth goal as he tried a wraparound and the puck slid just wide of the far post. A few minutes later, Tyler Johnson set him up on a 2-on-1, Kucherov blasted a one-timer from between the circles that Condon took right in the chest protector.  While the Senators kept picking up shots, they werenêt of the threatening quality. The 15 shots Vasilevskiy faced in the first period were from dangerous areas. As the game wore on, more and more of the shots came from the point or from the boards, much easier for the big netminder to stop. The Triplets kept the foot on the gas as Kucherov rang one off the post. The puck came out to Coburn, who celebrated his 32nd birthday by pinging the puck off the correct side of the crossbar and into the net. Kucherov picked up an assist for his fourth point of the night. Ottawaês frustration came to a boiling point after Cedric Paquette clipped Tommy Wingels with about 7 minutes to go in the game. Paquette squared off briefly with former Bolt Mike Blunden while Gabriel Dumont fired some jabs at Chris Wideman. The Lightning easily killed off the ensuing shorthanded situation (Paquette had a tripping penalty to go along with his roughing penalties) as the Senators looked like a team that just wanted the game to end so they could get back home after a long road trip. Game Notes Chris Kontos is the only other member of the Lightning to score 3 power play goals in a period and he did it against Chicago in Tampa Bayês inaugural game...Kyle Turrisê goal was his 300th career NHL point...Point has six goals since returning from his hand injury...Drouinês 3 assists were a regular season career high. He also had 3 assists in Game 5 against the Red Wings in last seasonês playoff matchup.   "

Burrows scored twice in his debut with the Senators and led his new club to a 2-1 win over the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday night. He was traded by the Vancouver Canucks to Ottawa on Monday for prospect Jonathan Dahlen. Burrows had played his previous 822 games with the Canucks. His first goal was on a seemingly harmless shot from low in the faceoff circle. ""It's just getting pucks on net. If you keep doing the right things over and over you're going to get results,"" said Burrows, who was impressed with the play of his new teammates. ""That's one thing we used to talk about in Vancouver, getting pucks on net, and it's the same message here in Ottawa. ""I said (Thursday) morning it would be the best day if we could win, and we found a way to get it done. I was really impressed by the way everyone competed, blocking shots and paying the price. I like the way we played. There's a lot of good players here and if we play the right way, we'll have success. "" Hoffman had two assists for the Senators, while Craig Anderson had a relatively quiet night needing only 22 saves for the win. He did, however, make a great right-pad stop on John Mitchell who was alone in tight on Anderson early in the third period. Rene Bourque scored for the Avalanche, who were kept in the game with a strong performance from Calvin Pickard, who made 40 saves. Bourque scored at 5:25 of the third period, breaking anderson 's shutout bid as he took a pass from Nathan MacKinnon and put a shot over anderson 's shoulder and in. ""It was a tight game all the way through and we were right there at the end with a big third-period goal. Their goalie made some good saves and you have to give them some credit. They played a great game,"" Pickard said. The Senators led 2-0 after two periods and had outshot Colorado 30-15 over that span, including 17-5 in the second period. The Avalanche didn't get their first shot of the second until the period was half over. Burrows scored his second goal of the game at 15:41 of the second to put Ottawa ahead 2-0, but it was the work of Hoffman that allowed the goal to happen. Hoffman went behind the Avalanche net on a one-man forecheck and stole the puck behind the net before finding Burrows streaking in unchecked from the blue line. Burrows beat Pickard with a quick shot with all five Colorado skaters in the defensive zone against just two Senators. ""It's very nice to see him come in here and starting his career with the Senators off that way,"" Hoffman said of Burrows, then adding the win was the biggest thing. ""That's what we wanted, especially coming off our four-game road trip. We wanted to start this home swing on a good note and obviously the two points are big. "" Hoffman also had an assist on Burrows' first goal as a member of the Senators. After getting the puck from Hoffman, Burrows skated along the left wall and beat Pickard with a shot from the far edge of the faceoff circle at 8:39 of the opening period. NOTES: Jyrki Jokipakka, Fredrik Claesson and Chris DiDomenico were the scratches for the Senators on Thursday. .... Sven Andrighetto and Cody Goloubef were scratches for the Avalanche. .... Erik Karlsson played in his 311th consecutive game on Thursday, tying him with Chris Phillips for the most in franchise history. ... Avs forward Matt Duchene has gone five straight games without a point. ... JT Compher made his Avalanche and NHL debut on Thursday. UP NEXT: Avalanche: Colorado will conclude a three-game road trip Saturday against the Winnipeg Jets. Senators: Ottawa will play the second of a three-game homestand when it hosts the Columbus Blue Jackets on Saturday.  ",nkb,Sens Top Avs 2-1,"Tonightês match-up against the Colorado Avalanche was one of the most anticipated of the entire season for one reason, and one reason only: the return of Patrick Wiercioch. I kid. Jokes aside, there was an abundance of reasons for Sens fans to be excited for tonightês game: Alex Burrows and Viktor Stalberg were set to make their Sens debut and with the trade deadline behind us, the push for the play-offs was well and truly underway. Colorado has been easily the worst team in the NHL in this season   in fact, by virtually any measure theyêve been historically bad. For most of the night, they looked the part: Ottawa dominated the shot clock to the tune of 42-23 overall and had the Avalanche pinned in their end for long stretches of the game. In the first frame alone, the Sens drew three penalties through their relentless pressure and pursuit of the puck. After a couple of good chances for Mike Hoffman yielded no goals, it was Burrows who gave the home team the lead just less than nine minutes into the game: The shot wasnêt a thing of beauty, but the cross ice pass from Mike Hoffman to set up the goal more than made up for the finish. Hoffmanês sometimes been accused of being on the wrong side of the risk-reward balance, but itês plays like these that make him one of the most dangerous players in the NHL. More of that, please. The second period actually didnêt start especially well for Ottawa, as Colorado mounted some sustained pressure and only a couple of sharp saves from Craig Anderson kept the Sens ahead. That wouldnêt last, however: the Sens dominated the last two thirds of the frame, and amazingly enough Burrows got his second of the game with just over four minutes remaining. It was Hoffman again setting Burrows up for his opportunity, but this time Burrows finished in style with a toe-drag into a top shelf snipe. Thereês been (fairly) a lot of hand-wringing about the price Dorion paid to acquire Burrows, but if heês going to play even half this well then all will soon be forgotten. In the third, Colorado made the outcome a lot more uncomfortable than it should have been with a Rene Bourque tally but could never quite find the equalizer. Erik Karlsson was superb at both ends of the rink, blocking several Avalanche shots, breaking up dangerous plays and generally controlling play in the offensive end. Burrows was named the gameês first star, which is fair enough considering he scored both goals, but it says here Karlsson was the best player on the ice for either team. Another vintage performance from the captain. At the end of the day, this was the perfect first opponent for the new look Senators. Colorado have been pushovers all year and tonightês game, final score notwithstanding, was no different. It never felt like Ottawa was seriously in danger of not winning in regulation. In that sense, itês mission accomplished. But as we all know, you only get so many games against Colorado (one more to be precise). The real test lies ahead yet. Sens Hero: Alex Burrows Burrows became the first Ottawa Senator to ever score two goals in his debut for the team, so you might say heês off to a good start Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson The captain was incredible, and despite being held pointless he effectively carried a huge burden at both ends of the ice tonight. Sens Killer: Calvin Pickard The only thing standing between Ottawa and a five goal night was Calvin Pickard who made 40 of a possible 42 saves on the evening.  ",Mile High Hockey,Avalanche remain the same in 2-1 loss to Senators,"Any hope that the Colorado Avalanche would be a different hockey club following the trade deadline quickly dissipated. Any chance that the group of guys who didnêt get traded would be excited to finish the season with the club are gone. _Iêm just happy to get back to hockeyÓ was the quote from the players on the team who were rumored to be traded. Could have fooled me.  This is the same Colorado Avalanche club that started the season. Joe Sakic failed to make any major changes off the ice on Wednesday, thus no major changes were made on the ice in a 2-1 loss against the Ottawa Senators on Thursday.  The team looked asleep in the first two periods. Alex Burrows scored both goals for the Senators. The first came off a bad angle shot that hit the stick of an Avalanche defender. How many times have we heard that one this year? The second came after a steal along the boards, a pass into the slot, and a great shot.  Alex Burrows is a 35-year-old forward who was scheduled to put a free agent at the end of this season. His production has dramatically dipped over the last few years as the Canucks have gotten worse since their run to the Cup finals. Heês also not the most well-liked player in the league due to his on-ice antics. Somehow, the Canucks managed to sell his abilities to the Senators for Jonathan Dahlen, the 42nd overall pick in 2016.  Thatês the difference between smart offices and the Avalanche front office. Sakic failed to get rid of guys like Blake Comeau, John Mitchell, Fedor Tyutin, Joe Colborne, Rene Bourque, Cody Goloubef, etc— and we all assume that itês because there was no market for any of those guys. Weêve seen them play all season, we know they arenêt very good. But maybe they arenêt very good because this team isnêt very good? Maybe they just need to be in a different system with a better coach in order to thrive? It worked for Burrows tonight. And Cody McLeod seems to be doing alright in Nashville. Itês Sakicês job sell other teams on his guys, no matter how poorly theyêre playing, and he failed miserably at doing so.  The Avs finally showed a little life in the third period, cutting the lead in half on a goal by Bourque, but 20-minutes of slightly above average hockey doesnêt make up for 40-minutes of lifelessness. In the final minute and a half, Jared Bednar pulled Calvin Pickard for the extra attacker. The Avs failed to register a single shot on goal. They have control of the puck in the offensive zone for just under a minute and decided to pass it around the perimeter for a good thirty seconds, looking for the perfect play.  Thatês been the issue for the team all year. They want to hit the perfect play, instead of going hard to the net and working for the tough goals. They want to curl instead of drive. They want to thread the needle instead of shoot. And when they do shoot, they try to be too fine and often miss the net.  If youêve watched one Colorado Avalanche game this year, youêve watched 90% of them. Donêt feel bad for miss On the positive side, J.T. Compher looked good in his Avalanche debut. By _good,Ó I mean he looked like he cared and was excited to be there. He worked hard and battled, which is more than I can say about pretty much every other player wearing an Avalanche jersey tonight. The call-up of Compher is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, aside from him and Sven Andrighetto, who should join the team in their next game, this is the same group of guys who have failed to inspire any hope and confidence all season.  And it wonêt be long until Compher and Andrighetto fall into the Avalanche of misery.  "

Zack Smith scored his league-leading fourth short-handed goal in the third period and the Senators beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 3-2 on Saturday night. ""I think it was a hard-fought game,"" Ottawa captain Erik Karlsson said. ""I think they played a really good game and they made it really tough for us, but we stuck with it for the 60 minutes and we battled hard. "" Senators coach Guy Boucher rolled all four lines with every forward playing more than ten minutes. ""Last ten, 15 minutes of the game, our players have so much juice now,"" Boucher said. ""It's good to see. Guys are playing different roles and can focus on the roles that they're asked to play. It's really good to manage. "" Viktor Stalberg got his first goal since joining the Senators ahead of Wednesday's trade deadline. Erik Karlsson scored his 11th of the season and Craig Anderson made 25 saves. Stalberg was traded to Ottawa by the Carolina Hurricanes for a 2017 third-round draft pick on Tuesday. Brandon Saad and Sam Gagner scored for the Blue Jackets. Joonas Korpisalo played just his eighth game this season and made 24 saves. This was the first regulation loss for Columbus in five games (3-1-1). ""We created some opportunities,"" Columbus coach John Tortorella said. ""Three posts, had some looks, had some missed chances, (Anderson) made some good saves. The game could have gone either way, but we ended up on the wrong end of it. They score three, we have two. "" Trailing 2-1 late in the third, Columbus had a power play and pulled Korpisalo to try and score the equalizer, but the Senators were able to take advantage when Smith scored into the empty net to make it 3-1. Gagner scored a power-play goal with just over two minutes remaining in regulation to cut Ottawa's lead to 3-2. A hard fought second period saw the Senators come out with a 2-1 lead as Mark Stone made an outstanding no-look pass to Karlsson, who snapped a shot past Korpisalo. Anderson had a little luck on his side as both Zach Werenski and Oliver Bjorstrand rang shots off the post. Ottawa tied it at 1 midway through the first when Stalberg jumped on a loose puck in the crease. Columbus opened the scoring just two minutes into the game when Werenski made a great pass to Saad, who wired a shot off the post to beat Anderson. NOTES: This was the third and final meeting of the regular season between the two teams with the Senators winning the series 2-0-1. ... Ottawa D Jyrki Jokipakka, D Fredrik Claesson and C Christopher DiDomenico were healthy scratches. ... Columbus D Scott Harrington, D Markus Nutivaara and C TJ Tynan were healthy scratches. UP NEXT Blue Jackets: Play at New Jersey on Sunday. Senators: Host Boston on Monday night.  ",Colin4000,"Sens zip Jackets, win 3-2","The Ottawa Senators returned to home ice on Saturday to face the Columbus Blue Jackets. Columbus (40-16-6) is one of the Metropololitan divisionês four firepower teams, comfortably sitting in the same divisional position as the Sens but with a dozen more points. It was the Sens however who prevailed, with the added depth playing a key role in earning the two points. Craig Anderson would also continue his dominant season, stopping 25 of 27 shots en route to a 3-2 victory. The first period didnêt begin quite as planned for the Senators, as Zach Werenski cut through two Sens players and fed the puck to Brandon Saad, who fired it past Anderson. It was Saadês 20th goal of the season, and the Jackets jumped to the early 1-0 lead.  With a first round playoff matchup between Ottawa and Columbus a possibility, the two teams decided to get bit scrappy. With Craig Anderson along the end boards, Brandon Dubinskywent in to grab the puck and tripped Anderson with his skate in the process. Accidental or not, Sens enforcer Mark Borowiecki went right for Dubinsky, dropping the gloves. Dubinsky got called for tripping, and Boro got an instigator and his second misconduct of the season (tying him with Burrows). Columbus throughout the first period made a point of getting in front of Anderson, which led to some more skirmishing. Not long after the incident, deadline acquisition Viktor Stalberg found the puck in front of the net, and jostled off a Blue Jacket to put the puck past goaltender Joonas Korpisalo. With Burrows scoring two in the last game and Stalberg adding one tonight, Iêve got to say Iêm really looking forward to Jyrki Jokipakkaês Sens debut. Just give Dorion the GM of the Year Award already. Columbus would get some extended pressure late, although the defence would prevail sending both teams to the dressing room tied 1-1. The second period wasnêt as eventful in shots (total of 12 compared to 22 in the first), although the Sensê offence did a fantastic job of creating quality scoring chances. Passes were connecting, players were showing some creativity, and it didnêt come at the expense of the back check. They would catch some lucky breaks, though, as the Blue Jackets beat Anderson twice only to hit the post. The Sens would keep the offence rolling, dominating the period in scoring chances 12-2. Ottawa was the team to strike next, to put the team up 2-1. Mark Stone rushed into the zone fending off the Jacketsê deadline acquisition Kyle Quincey. Bursting towards the net, Stone used his superhuman vision to thread a backhand pass to a pinching Erik Karlsson. The captain made no mistake, ripping the rubber past Korpisalo. The Senators had to go to the penalty kill twice in the period, and both times you had to wonder why not every team is using the same system. It leaves the player on the point with very limited passing options, and the penalty killers were quick to calm down any chaos the Blue Jackets would try to create. It was simple, smooth, and most importantly effective. The second frame would come to a close up 2-1. Usually at this time of the game, the Sens would try to defend their lead. All three of their last three wins were by a score of 2-1, and this game couldêve been another. Tonight was the opposite, however, as the offence would continue to roll and create high danger chances. Yet, the game stayed 2-1 with three minutes left in the third period. On the power play, Columbus decided to pull their goalie to make it a 6-on-4. Pageau and Smith took objection quickly, with Zack Smith recording his team-leading fourth shorthanded goal of the season.  Sam Gagne would capitalize on the power play shortly after, and Columbus would continue to pile shots in the remaining minute and a half. Ottawa would hold on, though, sealing the victory 3-2.  Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson Karlsson played in his 312th consecutive game tonight, surpassing Chris Phillips for the longest iron man streak in Sens history (yes, more than Mike Condon). It was only appropriate that he would score the pivotal goal, as well as make some astounding defensive plays.  Honourable Mention: The depth Dorionês goal at the trade deadline was to add depth, and he did just that. Two games past March 1st, his moves have already been paying dividends, with Viktor Stalberg adding a goal tonight.  The rest of the depth corps, both offensively and defensively, was fantastic as well. Players like Wingels, Pageau and Kelly were not only keeping their heads above water, but they were clearly outplaying the opposition. Mark Borowiecki, although I may not personally agree with his decision to instigate, held off the opposition cleanly finishing with a team-leading 73.91 CF%. This is the type of depth play weêve been begging for for years, and it appears as if weêve finally got it. Honourable Mention: Mark Stone He received plenty of offensive chances, and created many more with his unbelievable stick control. Some of his takeaways tonight left my jaw hanging.  Honourable Mention: Craig Anderson Should I continue to go down the list? Andy was living on the edge tonight making some dangerous passes, one of which had to be bailed out heroically by Cody Ceci. Besides that, he was able to stand his ground, allowing only the two goals on Columbusê 21 shots. Sens Killer: Zach Werenski Wherever the young blueliner was on the ice, he was having a positive impact for Columbus. Breaking the puck out, creating offensive chances, sustaining zone time, Werenski did it all. Hopefully he can continue to gain ground and beat out Matthews for the Calder.  ",,,

Mike Hoffman had the power-play winner early in the third period and the Senators defeated the Boston Bruins 4-2 on Monday night. The win allowed the Senators, who are second in the Atlantic Division, to take a four-point lead on the third-place Bruins and still hold two games in hand. ""That was one of the toughest games we've played all year,"" Hoffman said. ""For the whole 60 minutes we had to be sharp, we had to be on our toes. I thought everyone played sharp. "" Derick Brassard, Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Alex Burrows, with an empty-net goal, also scored as the Senators extended their winning streak to three games. Craig Anderson made 25 saves against the Bruins, who will play Ottawa twice more in the regular season. Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand scored for Boston and Tuukka Raskmade 25 saves. The Bruins anticipated a hard-fought game, but struggled against the Senators' forecheck. ""They played their game better than we played ours in a nutshell,"" Boston coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""It was a little disappointing at times that we were that stubborn. "" With just six home games remaining, the Senators gave the crowd at Canadian Tire Centre something to remember in what could be a preview of a first-round playoff matchup should the standings remain as they are. Ottawa took a 3-1 lead early in the third as Hoffman scored his 20th on the power play. It was Ottawa's first goal with the man advantage in three games. The lead was short-lived as less than two minutes later the Bruins scored on the power play as Marchand picked up David Pastrnak's rebound to score his 30th, giving him back-to-back 30-goal seasons. Shortly after there was a strange turn of events in the third when it appeared Hoffman was going to take a slashing penalty, but then the officials overturned the call after realizing Marchand's stick had broken in the act of shooting. Cassidy had never seen anything like it and was still confused by it after the game. ""It was a funny call. Through the course of the game most officials would tell you there's times they look back and tell you that was one I probably missed, but they don't tell you until after the game or the next day so again it was interesting to say the least. "" There were no goals in the second, but the Senators clearly held the edge in the period, outshooting the Bruins 16-5. ""We played a complete game against a team that's played very well,"" said Dion Phaneuf, who wasn't expected to play as he wasn't feeling well at the morning skate. ""It feels good when you come in and compete the way that we did together. We come out with the result that we wanted in a race that's tight. "" Ottawa had a number of chances as the Bruins turned the puck over several times, but Rask was solid and got a little help when Phaneuf rang a shot off the post. ""We knew it was going to be a hard game and we definitely didn't have the start we would have liked,"" Marchand said. ""We kind of played into their system. We didn't get enough pucks in deep and that's the game you have to play against this team with the five guys in the neutral zone they really clog it up so we have to get in a little bit more than we did and hopefully we can do a little bit better next game. "" The Senators had a strong start to the game as they held a 2-1 lead after 20 minutes. ""I thought we came out real focused, real strong,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""When they got that goal we had a great push back. "" Trailing 2-0, the Bruins cut the lead in half as Bergeron took a pass from Torey Krug in the slot and quickly turned and beat Anderson with a wrist shot in the final minutes of the period. Brassard opened the scoring at 1:21 as he managed to beat Rask with a turnaround shot through traffic and Ottawa took a 2-0 lead just three minutes into the game as Pageau redirected phaneuf 's point shot. NOTES: Ottawa D Fredrik Claesson, D Jyrki Jokipakka and C Christopher DiDomenico were a healthy scratch. The Senators remain without Bobby Ryan and Chris Neil, who both have broken fingers. The Bruins RW Jimmy Hayes, D John-Michael Liles, D Joe Morrow and LW Matt Beleskey were a healthy scratch. Adam McQuaid was back in the lineup Monday. The Bruins defenseman needed over 20 stitches Saturday after taking a skate blade to the neck. UP NEXT: Bruins: Boston hosts Detroit on Wednesday night. Senators: Ottawa begins three-game road trip at Dallas on Wednesday night.  ",Ary M,Karlsson leads Sens over Bruins; win 3rd straight,"If thatês what a Bruins - Senators series is going to look like, sign me up. 100 5-on-5 shot attempts, miraculously ending at an even 50/50 split, is only one indicator of how fast-paced and physical tonightês game was. Of course, that means Guy _Trap The Neutral ZoneÓ Boucher may find some more faults in tonightês game than I will, but Iêm sure heêll be happy with a win that puts the Senators four points up on the Bruins with two games in hand.  The Senators were led by their Captain tonight, as Erik Karlsson continued his best offensive stretch of the season   with 11 points in 10 games and 25+ minutes of ice-time in six of them. Funnily enough, he wasnêt a factor on the teamês first two goals.  Derick Brassard started the festivities on his first shift of the night with a floating wrist shot that beat Tuukka Rask. Brassard, who was flying tonight, showed his speed to enter the Bruins zone with control and fired a shot on Rask that was kicked away with his right pad. Burrows, crashing for a rebound, caused the Bruins to run around a bit by firing a hard shot attempt towards the net, and the puck eventually found its way to Brassard in the high slot. With Mark Stone screening Rask in front, all three members of the Burrows - Brassard - Stone line contributed positively for their second game in a row. Just over two minutes later, Jean-Gabriel Pageau doubled the Sens lead. The big offensive contribution on this goal came from Dion Phaneuf, who wasnêt even supposed to play tonight. After Pyatt won the puck behind the net as he often does, Phaneuf ended up with the puck at the left point. Instead of trying to wind up for a big slapper, Phaneuf half-clapped a low shot towards the net that Pageau tipped past Rask. A smart decision that payed off, and gave the Sens a 2-0 lead just four minutes into the game. The Bruins started to push back though, and Craig Anderson earned the bulk of his pay in the first period. In numbers: the Bruins had 25 of the 50 5-on-5 attempts, 13 of their 25 shots, and 11 scoring chances (4 high-danger) in the first period   numbers that they didnêt reach in the second and third periods combined. In particular, the trio of Marchand - Bergeron - Backes did a majority of the damage and it was Bergeron who made it a one-goal game late in the first. After Ceci made a soft turnover on the wall that was cut off by a pinching Torey Krug, the puck ends up with Bergeron who spun and fired it past Andy for his 17th of the year. Boucher pressed a bunch of the right buttons tonight, but the matchup pair of Phaneuf - Ceci got crushed tonight against the Bergeron line; the Bruins group finished the night with >65% of the shot attempts in their ~15 minutes of 5-on-5 ice-time, ~9-10 minutes of which were against Phaneuf - Ceci.  As much as the Bruins were strong in the first, the Sens were even better in the second. In fact, Iêd go as far to say that the second period was one of Ottawaês most dominant of the year, and definitely one of their most offensively creative despite not managing to put one of their 14 second period shots by Tuukka Rask to extend their lead. The Sens had 70% of the shot attempts in the period, and outside of the a momentum killing powerplay that was drawn by Mark Borowiecki (!), there looked to be a scoring chance on every other shift. You could really see the impact of Stalberg + Wingels, in that they not only did well in their minutes, but also allowed Boucher to spread around his ice-time. To that end, every Sens player played at least 12 minutes tonight   a stat that just wasnêt possible pre-deadline.  The third started off at a choppier pace compared to periods one and two, and although I donêt think you can say that the Sens _shut it downÓ, they managed to do enough good things to get the win. For one, the powerplay actually scored. What seems to happen is that when it clicks, it clicks, and that was the case tonight with a goal 14 seconds after David Pastrnak took a high-sticking minor on Dion Phaneuf. The drink that stirred the pot? Erik Karlsson, who snuck down from the right point after receiving the puck from Dion Phaneuf, only to send a sweet cross-ice feed to Mike Hoffman for his 20th of the year. Iêd be remiss if I didnêt mention Mark Stoneês work down low to get the puck free to Hoffman to start the rotation at the point. Itês another one of the little things Stone does right on any given night. Unfortunately for Ottawa, the Bruins responded just a minute later on a quick powerplay strike of their own. This time, the always-pesty Brad Marchand potted his 30th of the year with Viktor Stalberg in the box on a side play that Craig Anderson had absolutely no chance on while Cody Ceci boxed out no one and Zack Smith got lost in coverage down low.   Marchand was his usual self tonight: after whistle antics, speedy, and good. As Boucher and the Sens went into their usual _protect the leadÓ strategy with 10 minutes left in the third, the team did a solid job of protecting the neutral zone and limiting Bostonês shot attempts, killing the clock slowly. When Tuukka Rask left the net with around 1:30 left to play, Erik Karlsson fronted a shot and managed to chip the puck to Mark Stone, who banked it off the boards for Alex Burrows to skate into. The new Sens forward settled the puck down and potted his third goal in three games into the empty net to give Ottawa the 4-2 lead that held as the final score.  Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson Duh. But really, he was terrific tonight. Two assists, on the ice protecting the lead with less than a minute left against a team right below in the standings, and fantastic defensive effort. Sens Hero: Team Speed I donêt know about you, but it looked like many of the players had rockets attached to their skates tonight. It was the fastest Iêd seen Derick Brassard in my lifetime, while Smith and Pageau looked like they had an extra step with them tonight as well.  Honourable Mention: Craig Anderson Anderson didnêt have to be a ton of high calibre saves tonight, but I felt that he controlled rebounds well and was there in the first period to keep the Sens on top until they could add to their lead in the third. He still has to stop playing the puck because it almost always ends up in the hands of the opposition, but maybe heêll learn one day?  ",Stanley Cup of Chowder,"Bruins fall to Senators, 4-2","What an up-and-down game... the Bruins played awful through the first 40 minutes, but found life with ten minutes left in the game. The highlight was Brad Marchand scoring his 30th goal of the season, becoming the 8th Bruin to score 30 or more goals in consecutive seasons. He and Patrice Bergeron scored, and David Pastrnak showed us maximum effort.  First Period From the opening faceoff, the Bruins were chasing the puck, and the Senators were able to set up in the Bês end. Derick Brassard retrieved a rebound, circled to the point, and snuck a shot through a few screens 1:21 into the game. 1-0, Senators. The Bês came back hitting, and Frank Vatrano buried Sens D-man Chris Wideman in the corner; it looked like a rough landing but he popped right back up. Fellow defenseman Dion Phaneuf fired a point shot that was tipped in front by Pageau, to put the Senators up 2 less than five minutes into the game. 2-0, Senators.  The Bruins, though in full scramble mode, manage to sneak a few shots through on Andersen, but heês up to the task. Bergeron, Marchand and David Backes all had a chance at a shot and rebounds in front, but they shot for the same spot - Craig Andersenês chest - and Andersen closed the door. The line gets two more chances on their next shift, but still had nothing to show for it. Brandon Carlo, characteristic of the Bruins as a whole this period, was not on top of loose pucks. The 4th line added some forecheck, keeping the puck behind Andersen for better than half their shift - a welcome change. In the second half of the period, the Bruins began trailing the puck and couldnêt get a clean breakout, let alone exit their own zone cleanly. The puck was hopping all over the place, not just on the Bruins; Ottawa, however, was just more effective at settling the bounces.  With the top line humming, Marchand made life tough on Pageau and Cody Ceci, who was forced to send a chip up the boards. Krug got a piece of a centering pass, and as it floated into the high slot, Bergeron collected it, wheeling and firing the puck past Andersen to score the Bês first goal of the game with just over a minute and a half left in the period. 2-1, Senators. The period ended with a rerun - the Bruins chasing the puck In their own zone. Thankfully, the horn would sound on the first without more damage. Second Period The Bruins iced the puck to start this one. Pastrnak made a great move around Erik Karlsson, but couldnêt tuck the puck around Andersen on a strong defensive play by Ottawa. Kevan Miller and Ryan Dzingel mixed it up in front of Tuukka after a stoppage, but no fisticuffs just yet. Rask made a huge save off a loose puck that trickled to a Senator in the low slot. On the next rush, he thwarted another attempt from nearly the same spot. Pastrnak nearly had another rush but Karlsson catches him and forced him out. This game began to get much more physical with five minutes played, with hip checks from Schaller and Marchand upending a couple Sens. The third icing of the period by the Bruins pinned the Bergeron line for a moment, but Bergeron won a board battle to get the puck deep and nearly swung another hail-mary shot through Andersen. Pastrnak is making Ottawa look silly tonight with dekes, just hasnêt been able to settle the puck on the other side of his move. Drew Stafford was called for a holding penalty Behind the Bês net, and Ottawa held the first unit of penalty killers in the zone for more than a minute, while Chara took a slash behind the play. Ottawa would build on their zone time as the penalty expired, and fortunately Rask was able to freeze the puck. Krejciês line got stuck deep again; of the trio, only Pastrnak has looked dangerous so far. The passes from Cehlarik and Krejci arenêt connecting to the speedy winger. The line gets pinned deep, so Chara is forced to ice the puck, and the line is stuck out there for another minute. Cehlarik ices the puck again, so Cassidy is forced to use his timeout. Pastrnak finally broke free and fired a shot on Andersen from center ice to get the line change. Marchand got tangled with Pageau behind Tuukkaês net with under 30 seconds to go in the period, and theyêd get sent off for matching minors, resulting in 4-on-4 for the rest of the period and the beginning of the third. No Senators goals during the  Third Period Coming back to 4-on-4 play, Chara was paired with Colin Miller to try and spark a bit of offense. No luck. Returning to 5-on-5, Cassidy shuffled lines to put Pastrnak back on the top unit with Marcheron, sliding Stafford up to play on Krejciês right side opposite Cehlarik, and Backes in Staffordês RW spot on the third line. Pastrnak took an uncharacteristic high-sticking penalty out of frustration, and Ottawa capitalized immediately, with Erik Karlsson sending the puck rinkwide to winger Mike Hoffman at the opposite point. 3-1, Sens. About a minute later, Stalberg interfered with Spooner following a dump-in, putting the Bruins on the power play. The Bruins would fire right back, with a long shot by Pastrnak getting saved by Andersen, the rebound tumbling to Marchandês feet for the chip-in. 3-2, Sens. The Bruins woke up out of their slumber with just over ten minutes to go, with another net-front tip by Stafford that went wide and more strong cycle to follow. While the Bergeron line would continue buzzing, and finally some successful board play by the Krejci line, the Bês just couldnêt capitalize on a handful of rebounds in the last few minutes. With Rask pulled, Ottawaês Alexandre Burrows - of ALL Senators to do this to us - put the nail in the coffin. 4-2, final score. Game Notes Bergeronês 17th and Marchandês 30th goals just continue to show who runs this team offensively. When the team was stalling in the second period, needing that tying goal, Pastrnak shouldêve joined them immediately. Coach Bruce Cassidy can balance his lines all he wants, but when he needs a goal, he should know where to turn. Where was David Krejci tonight? He still has flashes of brilliance, but he spent time trying to sneak around and carry the puck, and when Ottawa took away his time and space, he coughed the puck up, and having a rookie winger didnêt help. Ottawa had their number all night, and their only saving grace was the threat of a Pastrnak breakaway. The Bruins play Ottawa twice more this season, including the second-to-last game of the season. The Bês need to recapture the magic from the first week under Cassidy, and fast. The Toronto Maple Leafs play the Detroit Red Wings tomorrow; Detroit is likely out, but Toronto still sits just four points back of Boston. Cêmon, Wings!  "

Claesson scored his first NHL goal and added an assist to help the Senatorswin their fourth straight game, 5-2 over the Dallas Stars on Wednesday night.. ""When you end up deciding that you're going seven and 11 (forwards) and your seven gets a goal and an assist, I think it's one of those days that you go to bed thinking you're smart,"" Boucher said. ""He's a good player, we know that. Knock on wood, we haven't had many injuries on D and so he's had to wait his turn more often than he deserved. "" Claesson scored with a slap shot from the top of the slot to give Ottawa a 2-0 lead at 15:21 of the first period. He was playing in his 36th game. ""It feels really good. I kind of waited for this moment for a long time. It was a faceoff. I just hammered an old knuckle puck there. I wasn't sure at all that it went in. "" Craig Anderson made 35 saves and tied Patrick Lalime for the Ottawa franchise record with 146 victories. ""It's a credit to the guys in front for all these years of hard work and dedication,"" Anderson said,""and just a byproduct of guys playing hard in front of me. "" Ottawa moved within four points of first-place Montreal in the Atlantic Division. The Senators' winning streak began after they acquired Viktor Stalberg and Alexandre Burrows near the trade deadline. Stalberg also had a big night, with a goal and assist on the power play. Ottawa was 2 for 3 with the man advantage after going 2 for 16 in its previous six games. Adding Stalberg to the power play was another decision that worked out for Boucher. ""It's all about deserving, and when a guy like that deserves it every night in the fourth game with us, it doesn't matter if he's new, he deserved it, so he got the ice time and he definitely helped us win this game again. "" Cody Ceci also each had a goal and an assist for the Senators, and Mike Hoffman had two assists. Chris Wideman and Jean-Gabriel Pageau also scored against Dallas starting goalie Kari Lehtonen, who left at 3:21 of the second period after allowing three goals in 18 shots. Antti Niemi replaced Lehtonen. Ottawa didn't have a shot on goal against Niemi for 14:48, until Stalberg scored on the power play for a 4-1 lead. Tyler Seguin and Jason Spezza scored for Dallas. Niemi stopped only three of five shots. Ottawa took a 2-0 lead when Zack Smith won a faceoff and the puck went to Claesson. ""The guys were great tonight right off the bat,"" Anderson said. ""We pushed back after they came out of the gate flying. We're able to get to a 2-0 lead there at the end of the first and we didn't turn it down at all. We kept the pressure up and took over the second period. "" Stars coach Lindy Ruff gave Anderson more credit. ""I thought their goaltender gave them a hell of a game. "" Notes: The Stars signed RW Adam Cracknell to a one-year contract extension for $675,000. In his seventh season, the first with Dallas, he has career highs of seven goals and 54 games played. ... Ottawa C Kyle Turrismissed his first game this season because of an injured finger. ... In pageau 's past four games against the Stars, he has six points (three goals, three assists). He won 13 of 15 faceoffs. ...

UP NEXT Senators: Play the second of three road games in four nights on Friday at Arizona. Stars: Begin a four-game trip on Sunday at San Jose.  ",Beata Elliott,"Goaltending, Depth Lead Ottawa Senators to 5-2 Win Over Dallas Stars","There was a certain sense of apprehension going into tonightês matchup against the Dallas Stars, the first in a three game road trip against some of the worst teams in the league. While the last part of that sentence would be reassuring to fans of any of the other 29 NHL teams, we Sens fans know all too well how badly our team tends to play against weak opponents. However, those who doubted the Sens did not take into account the fact that the Dallas Stars are essentially the pre-System Ottawa Senators (complete with Jason Spezza!), and if this year has taught us anything, itês that teams that use The System are always better than teams that donêt. The System is all-powerful, and opponents are helpless against it. (It also helps to face goalies that look like they would have trouble stopping a beach ball, but letês just pretend we earned that win because weêre on a four game streak now.) Tonight was an excellent demonstration of Dallas Stars hockey: a messy back-and-forth that made the other teamês offense look really good and their defense look really, really bad. Itês kinda nice to be on the other side of that for once. Is this how it felt to play the Sens a few years ago? Except, you know, minus the goaltending? This game almost felt like the completion of a prophecy, the final step in Ottawaês rebirth as a Good Team, as they returned with more structure and depth to slay their former self and prove once and for all that they have changed for the better. The game kicked off with a series of excellent chances from the Dallas Stars, as Craig Anderson was forced to stand on his head during a particularly painful sequence reminiscent of the good old defensive breakdowns we used to see on a nightly basis here in Ottawa. I donêt miss those days. The Sens did get a number of odd-man rushes and quite a few good chances, though, with new acquisition Viktor Stalberg looking particularly dangerous in the offensive zone. Stalberg eventually drew a penalty, which led to a gorgeous powerplay goal from defenseman Chris Wideman. Only a few minutes later, Fredrik Claesson doubled the Sensê lead with his first NHL goal, a milestone thatês been a long time coming for a player who should have cemented his place in the lineup a long time ago. You have to wonder at this point if thereês anything the man can do to secure a regular spot on the blueline. It was also pretty nice to see one of our guys score his first NHL goal, considering how many are scored on us every season. Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored early in the second period to put Ottawa up by three goals, which prompted Dallas to pull Kari Lehtonen in favour of Antti Niemi. It didnêt take long for Tyler Seguin to respond for the Stars, tapping in a nice pass from former Senator Jason Spezza to shorten the lead to two goals. The game continued with both teams looking entirely undeserving of even a single point, until Viktor Stalberg scored a truly awful powerplay goal late in the second to put the Sens up 4-1. The third period was dominated by the Stars on the shot clock, with Dallas registering 17 shots to Ottawaês 2, yet the goaltending made the difference as each team managed one own-goal. The first was given to Jason Spezza and bounced off Mark Borowiecki, while the second was attributed to Cody Ceci. I donêt know how itês possible to look so bad and yet win so decisively. Sens Hero: Viktor Stalberg The deadline acquisition was all over the ice tonight, with a goal and an assist. He also got a number of stellar scoring chances, and drew the penalty that led to the first Senators goal. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson Andy stood tall throughout the game, and tied Patrick Lalime for most wins in a Sens uniform. Itês good to have him back. Honourable Mention: Fredrik Claesson Freddy gets the nod for scoring his first NHL goal, and generally being his usual steady self. What will it take for him to stay in the lineup? Honourable Mention: Depth The Sens were missing Kyle Turris tonight, and though his absence was certainly felt, the bottom six sure stepped up. We also had three young defensemen score, which showed depth all across the lineup. It certainly is a nice change to not have to worry about minor injuries at this point in the season.  ",Defending Big D,"Stars PK Fails Again, Dallas Drop 5-2 Decision to Ottawa Senators","The last few weeks were fun. Winning five of seven was fun. The trade deadline, though not the outcome many wishes, was still _funÓ. The Dads trip was fun. Adding Ales Hemsky and Remi Elie has been fun. Oh, good times. Tonight was kind of the _Alright now, settle downÓ of hockey games. Urinating in the bowl of Cheerios. All of 2016-2017ês greatest hits returned. ...Hits like: Penalty kill issues Goaltending issues Changing goaltenders Long periods of dominance with no offense to show Offensive zone penalties Mistakes by young defensemen Sticks not on the ice Penalty kill issues Yes, they were all there tonight, and itês a shame. They started the game like they were shot out of the old metaphorical cannon and pummeled the Sens with quality chances and a sort of ferocious rage that had the makings of Çunexpected delightê written all over it. For about nine minutes, anyway. They put 23 pucks toward the Ottawa net in those nine minutes as they buzzed. The remaining 11 minutes of the period would see them try just twice, after a Jamie Oleksiak penalty changed the vibe. Ottawa took a 2-0 lead to intermission on a goal that Kari Lehtonen had no chance of saving, and one that he probably did. The second period featured much the same, until it suddenly didnêt.  This is the black-hole-of-despair sandwich that can be the Dallas Stars. Two periods of dominant possession and unrelenting offensive pressure book-ending just... nothing... in the middle, during which the opposition gets theirs while the Stars get next-to-nothing. Ottawa went 14 minutes and 49 seconds between shots. And they scored on both of them So this season continues to be this season, and why any of this surprises me or raises my ire is hopefully of an indictment of how much I love Dallas Stars hockey and not my intelligence or understanding of things over which I can exercise zero control. Say what you want about Jamie Oleksiak- And some of that in the early going was brutal. The penalty was unnecessary and he was standing right in front of diminutive Pageau when he scored the third Ottawa goal- Not good, but heês doing a lot of good with the puck on his stick when heês using his feet. I donêt know if that means anything in the long run- His possession numbers are still bad. He is more pleasing to the eye, generally, that once he was. My two cents. Remi Elie gets his first NHL point and then gets to play with Tyler Seguin for a while after dishing one to him. Lindy Ruff and his meritocracy in full swing there. Jason Spezza scored on the power play in the third period but by then it was too late. The Stars had a chance early to take a lead on one and couldnêt, and had a chance to get one back in the second and couldnêt. By then the special teams battle on the night was already lost. The lovely Johns/Niemi weird bounce combination to give the 19th ranked offense in the league its fifth goal on the night was just the nice kick in the crotch we needed to deflate completely. And Kari Lehtonen was not happy. No, sir. He was not a happy boy at all.  Enjoy a pun, and then forget any of this ever happened:  "

The Senators' captain had two goals and an assist, including the winner 40 seconds into overtime, and Ottawa edged the Arizona Coyotes 3-2 on Thursday night for their fifth consecutive victory. Karlsson tied it 2-2 when the star defenseman put in a rebound at 12:47 of the third period. He has 17 points in his past 14 games and 61 points for the season. ""We created a lot of good scoring chances,"" Karlsson said. ""We stuck to it in overtime, it's a toss-up. You get the first break and we ended up capitalizing on it. "" The Senators moved within two points of first-place Montreal in the Atlantic Division. Jean-Gabriel Pageau also scored for Ottawa and Mike Condon had 39 saves. ""I don't see anybody better around,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said of Karlsson. ""It's unbelievable. He's doing it all. This guy is just golden right now in every aspect of the game. "" Brendan Perlini and Lawson Crouse scored for Arizona. Mike Smith made 28 saves. The Coyotes power play dropped to 3 of 39 over the past 13 games after an 0-for-4 night. Arizona has lost four of five. ""Some good, some bad,"" Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said. ""You would like to win that game but we didn't. "" The teams scored 41 seconds apart in the second period. Perlini took a pass from Tobias Rieder, with a defender on him, got a shot off from the left wing that slid under condon 's pads at 11:30 of the second period. It was Perlini's 11th goal of the season. Moments later, Pageau won a faceoff in the Coyotes' zone and skated toward the net, where he was in position to knock in a shot from Fredrik Claesson to tie it at 1 at 12:11 of the period. Arizona made it 2-1 late in the second on Crouse's goal. His wraparound went over the goal line with condon 's foot unable to stop the puck in time at 17:49. Crouse has four goals on the season. The Senators improved to 6-3-1 in the second of back-to-back games this season. ""We had to reload mentally for the third period, which we did,"" Boucher said. ""We found away. Our players have shown a lot of character throughout the year, so nothing new. "" Coyotes right wing Radim Vrbata played in his 1,000th NHL game, and was recognized on the video board during the first period. Vrbata leads Arizona in goals with 15 and assists with 33.

",Ross A,Karlsson steals an OT win for the Sens,"It wasnêt pretty, but the Senators managed to extend their win streak to five games, beating the Arizona Coyotes 3-2 in overtime. Captain Erik Karlsson was stellar, scoring two goals and assisting on the third, giving the Sens yet another key victory.  The game was notable because it marked the first NHL game for Chris DiDomenico. After being a 6th-round pick in 2007, it was a long time coming for his first NHL game, which must have felt good. Seriously, this guy played two seasons for a team in Italy named after cheese. It mustêve been weird to be born in Canada but playing in Italy with such an Italian name. Iêm guessing he thought this opportunity would never come, and even though he probably wonêt find his way into a lot of games, itês a nice story. Ottawa had the better of chances to start the first, but then fell off, almost liked theyêd played the night before. The Coyotes were helped out by DiDomenico taking the first two penalties of the game, ensuring heêd be on the scoresheet in his first NHL game. Arizona couldnêt get much going on the first, and after some good puck movement on the second Viktor Stalbergês speed forced Jacob Chychrun into a holding penalty, meaning the Sens survived both penalty kills and even got a shortened powerplay after the second. It didnêt do much, and after a Stalberg giveaway at the point Mike Condon had to make a sharp save on a Lawson Crousebreakaway. Then Arizona would get another great chance and Condon would make another great save, this time on Anthony Duclair. A big scrum would ensue, but because DiDomenico wasnêt involved, no penalties were called. And that would do it for the first, with the Sens thoroughly outplayed but still tied in a scoreless game. The second period would see an uptick in entertainment value. The Yotes got on the board first with Brandon Perlini having the chance to rush in on Marc Methot in snap a puck past Condon. That lead would only last 40 seconds though. Jean-Gabriel Pageau won an offensive zone draw and headed to the net. Fredrik Claesson unleashed a bomb from the point that Mike Smithfought off, but Pageau got the rebound with no Arizona skaters within a nautical mile of him. He calmly flipped the puck past a visibly disgusted Smith, restoring the tie. That also gave Claesson his eighth point in his past 10 games, which means heêll probably be scratched on Saturday. Ottawa couldnêt hold that though, because Josh Jooris forced the puck free from Erik Karlsson, and Lawson Crouse beat Anderson Condon with a wrap-around to restore Arizonaês lead. Ottawa looked like a tired team that would have a hard time coming back in the third. The third period felt rather slow to start with, mostly due to an onslaught of penalties. Mike Hoffman went off for slashing, and then Marc Methot went off during that penalty for holding, giving the ÇYotes 20 seconds of 5-on-3. Ottawa would win the faceoff and fire it down the ice though, meaning it was really just a long time of 5-on-4. Just 27 seconds after the second penalty expired, Hoffman drew a tripping call, sending Ottawa to another powerplay (which of course they didnêt score on). Still, killing off two penalties in a row gave Ottawa a bit of jump. They were rewarded not long after the powerplay expired. A goal-mouth scramble led to Pageau sweeping the puck cross-crease to Karlsson who had a second to settle it down and wrist it past a helpless (M.) Smith. He looked pumped too after the goal. DiDomenico had been in that goal-mouth scramble, so Pageau kept the puck for him in case it was his first NHL point, but the scorekeepers didnêt give it to him. In my opinion that was correct since Arizona had earned possession after he last touched it, but as the commentators pointed out, if the game had been in Ottawa they wouldêve given it to him. That would essentially do it for regulation, and Ottawa headed to OT despite being outshot 41-30 to that point. The funny thing about shots is it only takes one to win a game. Thatês all it took in this overtime period. An errant drop pass missed Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Karlsson took the puck and immediately flew down the ice. Tom Pyatt kept pace to make it a 2-on-0, but Karlsson looked shot the whole way and put it in off the post. It seemed the right way to end it - the captain showing off his offensive flair, his speed, and his sense of fun when he was all smiles after sealing the deal. The win also put the Sens first in the Atlantic Division in points percentage because the Canadiens lost 5-0 (!!) to the Flames. (With Price, Radulov, and Plekanec all out, so donêt get too excited yet.) Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson Just a dynamite performance from the captain. When heês in this form, the team is near unstoppable. Sens Hero: Mike Condon Another big game for the back up. He made several strong saves with a tired team in front of him. Ottawa couldnêt have won if he hadnêt put up 39 saves on the night. Honourable Mention: Jean-Gabriel Pageau Two points, 53% on the faceoffs, 56% of the 5v5 shot attempts. A very good game for Pageau in Kyle Turrisê absence. The team is best when Pageau is the third-line centre, but itês nice to see him contribute when he needs to step up in the lineup.  ",Five For Howling,Special teams flatline in Arizona Coyotesê 3-2 OT loss to Ottawa Senators,"Tonight was Radim Vrbataês night, as the Arizona Coyotes recognized his 1,000th career game in the NHL. It would have been fitting for Vrbata to tally a point or a signature shootout goal. Unfortunately for Vrbata and the Coyotes, neither happened, as Arizona was unable to score on four power play opportunities and ultimately fell 3-2 to the Ottawa Senators shortly after overtime began on Thursday evening. Scoring Summary First Period Arizona had a couple of decent looks in the first period, but second-string goaltender Mike Condon was on form early for the Senators, and the game was scoreless through 20 minutes. Second Period 1-0 Arizona - Brendan Perlini broke the scoreless tie on a sizzling wrist-shot from the near-side that Marc Methot could not get in front of. The puck did not change direction, but Methotês effort may have distracted Condon just enough to let the puck get through. Assists to Tobias Rieder and Jordan Martinook on the goal at 11:30. 1-1 Tie - Less than a minute later, the Senators evened the score up after Fredrik Claessonês point shot was stopped by Mike Smith. Smith couldnêt corral the rebound, and Jean-Gabriel Pageau swooped in completely uncovered from below the red-line to put home the rebound. Assists to Claesson and Erik Karlsson on the goal at 12:11. 2-1 Arizona - Once again this season, Lawson Crouseês frame and wingspan paid dividends, as the grinder was able to swiftly wrap a puck around the back of the net and push the puck just past Condonês leg and in. The puck didnêt make it in far, but it made it completely over the line before being cleared, and thatês all that matters. Assist to Josh Jooris on the goal at 17:49. Third Period 2-2 Tie - Erik Karlsson demonstrated why he is one of the leagueês great defenseman by being in the right place at the right time to bang home a loose puck in the crease. Jean-Gabriel Pageau caused enough chaos in front to allow Karlsson to slide into the far-side faceoff circle unmarked and put home an easy rebound. Assist to Pageau on the goal at 12:47. Overtime 3-2 Ottawa - The season of frustration for Oliver Ekman-Larsson continues, as he lost the handle on a puck in the offensive zone and was unable to recover. Erik Karlsson made easy pickings of his fellow countrymanês mistake, and looked like a forward as he carried the puck into the Coyotesê zone unchallenged and roofed the game-winner over Smith. No assists on the overtime goal at :40. Three Answers Can the Coyotes create their own goals? - Perlini and Crouse did a great job creating opportunities for themselves on their goals, but Arizonaês power play once again failed to deliver when needed. Which Swede will reign supreme? - Karlsson had a spectacular night for Ottawa, and the last play of the game was emblematic of the way both playersê seasons have gone.ht for Ot Will Turris take over? - Turrisê finger was still not fully healed, and so he did not play in tonightês game. One suspects he was not wandering among the crowd during the game either. Players of the Game Ottawa - Erik Karlsson - Karlsson was a part of all three Ottawa goals on the night, with a pair of goals and a secondary assist. He also took six shots, blocked two more, and played nearly 30 minutes. Arizona - Radim Vrbata - Vrbata tied Jordan Martinook for most shots on net among Coyotes players with four. He deserved a better fate tonight, but getting to 1,000 games played in the NHL is special no matter what.

Anderson made 14 saves to set the franchise wins mark and the Senatorsdefeated the Colorado Avalanche 4-2 on Saturday night for their sixth consecutive victory. Alex Burrows and Mike Hoffman each had a goal and an assist for Ottawa, which tied Montreal atop the Atlantic Division with 84 points. Anderson earned win No. 147 with Ottawa to break a tie with Lalime for the top spot. ""Patrick's a great guy. I've met him numerous times,"" Anderson said after career win No. 234. ""I remember watching him in Ottawa when I was coming up through and trying to break into the league. Great guy, great goaltender, and it's an honor to be right there next to him. "" Fredrik Claesson and Ryan Dzingel also had goals for the Senators. Ottawa's winning streak started after it acquired Burrows from Vancouver on Feb. 27. He scored two goals in his debut, a 2-1 win over the Avalanche on March 2, and he has five goals against them this season. ""This year I've gotten a few breaks along the way, for some reason bounces are going in against this team,"" he said. Calvin Pickard stopped 27 shots and Matt Nieto and Sven Andrighettoscored for the Avalanche, who were eliminated from the playoffs with the loss. It is the third straight year they've failed to reach the postseason after posting 52 wins and 112 points in 2013-14. Nieto gave Colorado a 1-0 lead with his fifth goal midway through the first period, but Ottawa gained control in the second. Goals by Claesson, Burrows and Hoffman in the second made it 3-1. Dzingel scored at 11:22 of the third to seal the win. The Avalanche were trying for their first three-game winning streak of the season, but couldn't generate much offense against the Ottawa trapping defense after outshooting the Senators for most of the first period. They went the final 28:27 of the game with only two shots. Andrighetto ended a drought of 17:28 without a shot when he scored in the final minute. ""It just started from the neutral zone and our defensive zone; we couldn't break it out,"" Nathan MacKinnon said. ""They were all over us. I don't think we had any controlled entries. Every time we got the puck we were flat-footed and we had to chip it in. It's no fun playing like that, just dumping every puck in. "" Ottawa outshot Colorado 20-6 in the final two periods. The Senators head home for three straight games, the last of which is the first game of a home-and-home with Montreal that could help decide the division winner. ""We have had a strong last two weeks, but all we are focused on right now is getting points right now collecting as many as we can to try and set ourselves up for the playoffs,"" Hoffman said. NOTES: Colorado's 16 shots tied a season low. ... Senators D Mark Borowiecki missed his second straight game with an undisclosed injury. Second-leading scorer Mark Stone was out after suffering a lower-body injury against Arizona on Thursday. C Kyle Turris missed his third straight game with a fractured finger. ...

",Colin4000,"Ottawa Senators extend win streak to six, defeat Colorado Avalanche 4-2","A little over six years ago, the Ottawa Senators traded Brian Elliott to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Craig Anderson. Fast forward to now, and Anderson is the winningest goalie in Sens history, surpassing Patrick Lalime for 147 wins in an Ottawa jersey. It was only fitting that he made history against the team that traded him, helping the Sens sweep the road trip and win tonightês game 4-2. Coming in on a five game win streak, the Sens picked up right where they left off pouring on the offensive pressure early. That momentum came to a halt, when Chris DiDomenico, playing in his second NHL game at age 28, took a minor penalty for tripping. It was an unfortunate call, as heês now accumulated six penalty minutes since arriving in the NHL. The Sens would kill it off, and play would continue. The Avs would strike first halfway through, as recent waiver pick-up Matt Nieto tipped a shot past Craig Anderson to give Colorado the 1-0 lead. Cody Ceci lost his coverage in deep, and was caught puck-watching as Nieto was able to cleanly get the tip.  Viktor Stalberg and Fedor Tyutin would each exchange penalties late in the frame, although neither team could find the back of the net. Around halfway through the second period, Ottawa began to take over. Poor defensive coverage by the Avalanche left the hot hand Fredrik Claesson wide open, who rifled a shot past Calvin Pickard to tie the game. It was Claessonês second NHL goal, scoring his first on Wednesday in Dallas.  The tie wouldnêt last for very long. The only man-advantage of the period went to the Senators, who were able to capitalize. Hoffman sent a shot towards the net, and Alex Burrows, in only his sixth game since being acquired, tipped the puck for his fourth goal in the red and white. Not too long after that, Ottawa would extend their lead to two, with a Mike Hoffman snipe that bounced off of Pickardês shoulder and into the back of the net. Bang bang bang, the Sens went up 3-1 heading into the final 20 minutes. Period three needs only two words: The System. Colorado couldnêt get past the neutral zone, as the Sens had it trapped tighter than a Vancouverite in skinny jeans.  The Sens would make the game 4-1, getting another tip past Calvin Pickard, this time from Ryan Dzingel. The goal broke Dzingelês eight-game point drought, and also gave another point to Alex Burrows, who sent the shot in from the point. A series of penalties would give the Sens a brief 5-on-3 which would amount to nothing, and Dzingel would get bloody dropping the gloves with Gabriel Landeskog. Sven Andrighetto would score his first as an Avalanche with 11 seconds to go, although it wouldnêt matter The Sens would sail to the finish line victorious, winning 4-2 to extend their win streak to six games. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson As mentioned in the intro, tonight was a huge night for Andy. Heês been in Beast Mode ever since his return, and although he only had to face 16 shots, he kept the door shut. Tonight he solidified himself as the best goalie in Sens history, and weêve still got him for at least another season. Now only 12 more wins for the playoff record! Honourable Mention: Karlsson-Claesson-Wideman With two of Ottawaês top forwards in Stone and Turris out tonight, the defence stepped up big tonight, in an offensive way. Karlsson picked up two more assists to move him closer to Brent Burns for the defensive scoring lead. Claessonês blast gives him four points in his last three games. Wideman alone had eight shots on goal, half of the total of the entire Avalanche! It was a big night for all three. Honourable Mention: Alex Burrows Will he ever stop scoring? Before being trade, he was on pace for 13 goals. He scored goal #13 tonight, with 15 games left in the season. I highly doubt this is sustainable, but itês been getting the Sens wins.  Sens Killer: Calvin Pickard The young netminder made some crucial stops for the Avalanche tonight, including robbing Zack Smith of a surefire goal. He stopped 27 of 31 shots, and most of the goals allowed were due to the Colorado defence leaving Sens players wide open in front. He was definitely Coloradoês best player of the night.  ",Mile High Hockey,"Second period dooms Avalanche, fall to Senators 4-2","After winning their previous two contests, the Colorado Avalanche fell tonight to the Ottawa Senators after a frustrating three-goal second period that featured multiple head-scratching penalties and defensive plays from veteran players.  The Avalanche would get on the scoreboard first, setting up in the Senatorsê zone and moving the puck back up to the point. Blake Comeau passed to defenseman Cody Goloubef, who waited a moment for a screen to set up in front of the net and unloaded a slap shot. Matt Nieto, posted up in the slot, tipped the puck past former Avalanche goalie, Craig Anderson, to give Colorado a 1-0 lead.  Ottawa would tie the game midway through the second period after putting a strong forecheck in the Avalanche zone. Tom Pyatt won a puck battle in the corner against Mark Barberio and Jean-Gabriel Pageau swooped in to kick the puck back out in front of the net. His pass, however, would unexpectedly get redirected right to a wide-open Fredrik Claesson, who was able to take his time and fire off a wrist shot far-side past Calvin Pickard. Like weêve seen too often this season, the Senators would score two more in rapid succession. The first of which occurred following a really unnecessary Rene Bourque tripping penalty. Half a minute later, Mike Hoffman took a pass from Erik Karlsson, skated below the left circle and ripped a shot off of Pickardês pads. Alexandre Burrows, apparently in stealth mode, slipped the attention of nearby Fedor Tyutin, collected the puck and buried it to give his team their first lead of the game.  Hoffman would be primarily responsible for the next one too. After skating into the Avsê zone and pulling up, he waited for traffic to cross his shot path and sent a seemingly innocuous wrister at the net. Pickard clearly never saw it until it was sitting behind him and setting off the siren. Pickard would fare no better in the third. The Senators would score again to make it 4-1 when Burrows launched a wrist shot from the point with traffic in front. The puck would be tipped in the net yet again, this time by Ryan Dzingel with Derick Brassard providing additional screening higher in the slot.  The Avalanche took advantage of one last power play near the end of the game with, perhaps, their third unit on the ice. Carl Soderberg dished to Joe Colborne down below the goal line, who fed recent trade acquisition Sven Andrighetto out front for his first goal in an Avalanche uniform. More notable is that was his third point in four games since joining the team after the trade deadline. Alas, it was for naught.  Colorado will attempt to return to winning hockey again on Monday against the struggling Arizona Coyotes.  "

Victor Hedman scored with 55 seconds on the clock in overtime and Tampa Bay defeated the Ottawa Senators 2-1 on Tuesday night for its fourth straight victory. ""I think what's gotten us on this little run here is all teamwork. Everyone is working for each other and everybody plays their role and doing their thing and it pays off at the end,"" Lightning defenseman Anton Stralman said. ""It's all about consistency and right now everyone is doing the work. "" Ottawa goalie Mike Condon made 35 saves and was nothing short of spectacular at times. Still, the Senators had their six-game winning streak snapped. Brayden Point also scored for the Lightning, and Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 31 shots. ""I thought as every period went on we got stronger and stronger and stronger and it was almost like we got a little bit quicker,"" coach Jon Coopersaid. Tampa Bay is tied with the New York Islanders for the final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference, one point in front of Toronto. The Islanders currently hold the tiebreaker following a 3-2 victory in overtime at Carolinaon Tuesday night. The Maple Leafs lost 7-2 at Florida and fell out of playoff position. Cooper acknowledged that as stressful as every game is right now, it's also""a lot of fun. "" Tommy Wingels scored for the Senators, who earned one point and pulled within one of first-place Montreal in the Atlantic Division with two games in hand. ""Every point you put in the bank at this time of year is important, no doubt about it,"" Wingels said. ""We're disappointed in one out of two, absolutely, but it's about racking up those points any way you can. ""The point was important, we'll take that from it. But the better team, the more deserving team, got the two I think. "" Both teams played a solid game, but it was the Lightning who showed more energy in the third period despite having played the night before in New York. Ottawa coach Guy Boucher was less than impressed with his team's performance in the third, especially considering it was coming off two days of rest. ""It looked like the first game after a road trip,"" Boucher said. ""I thought the second period we started to get better and I thought it would carry into the third period, but it didn't. We tried to play run and gun with a team that's much better than us with that. They have more skill than us, and Condon saved us there and got us a point. "" Ottawa was without goaltender Craig Anderson, who is sidelined with a lower-body injury, as is right wing Mark Stone. However, the Senators did get Bobby Ryan back after he missed 11 games with a broken finger, and Kyle Turris returned after sitting out three games with a finger injury. The game was tied 1-all to start the third and neither team seemed able to grab momentum. Condon made a huge toe save on Nikita Kucherov midway through the period and went on to be even more impressive a couple of minutes later as Tampa Bay had multiple chances but just couldn't find a way to beat the Ottawa netminder. condon 's play had the 16,894 on hand chanting his name in an otherwise lackluster game. ""He was unbelievable. Big saves at big moments,"" Wingels said. ""There's a difference between making a save in a 5-1 game and making a save when the game's on the line and this guy made the save when the game was on the line many times. That's all you can ask for from your goalie. He was fantastic. "" Ottawa had a great opportunity to win late in the third when Tampa Bay was called for too many men on the ice, but the Senators were unable to capitalize. The Senators tied the score in the opening minutes of the second when Wingels fired a shot that beat Vasilevskiy stick side. Both teams had a number of good chances throughout the period, but were unable to capitalize. The Lightning opened the scoring three minutes into the period when Point jumped on a rebound down low and had a wide-open net. Tampa Bay nearly scored again in the waning seconds of the period, but Condon managed to reach back and stop the puck from crossing the goal line. NOTES: The Senators were without Anderson (lower body), Stone (lower body) and D Mark Borowiecki (lower body). Tampa Bay was missing C Tyler Johnson (lower body) and C Cedric Paquette (lower body). UP NEXT Lightning: At the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday night. Senators: Host the Chicago Blackhawks on Thursday night.  ",nkb,Lightning Down Sens 2-1 in O.T,"Of late, the Ottawa Senators have succeeded on the back of a Hart-worthy performance from Erik Karlsson, as well as Vezina-worthy work from Craig Anderson. When you have some of the best players in the game at their respective positions, and those players are playing at the apex of their abilities, you are going to win more than your share of games. However, over the course of an 82 game season, a good team will occasionally need to win games it doesnêt necessarily deserve to win. A good team will also, every so often, require that a member of the supporting cast reach far beyond their abilities and star in a winning effort. Alas, tonight was not one of those wins as the Sens fell 2-1 in overtime to the Tampa Bay Lightning. But this game would not have even reached overtime were it not for a goal from Tommy Wingels and a stellar performance from Mike Condon. At the morning skate it was announced that Chris Driedger had been recalled from Binghamton and that Anderson would be missing time with an undisclosed injury. Condon played a crucial role in keeping the team afloat while Anderson was away earlier in the season, but his play also tailed off noticeably towards the end of his run as the defacto number one. Sens fans had every reason to be a bit more on edge than usual. Nonetheless, the game started off well for the home side. Both teams seemed energized to start the first period and the up and down hockey was a fanês dream. Ottawa piled on the shots in the frame, 14 in all, but it was Tampa Bay who found the opener just over seven minutes into the game when Brayden Point potted a rebound on an odd man rush past a helpless Condon.  The Sens had a few flashes of brilliance, including a wonderful setup from Mike Hoffman that Jean-Gabriel Pageau fanned on, but they could not find the equalizer before the first twenty minutes elapse. It wasnêt long into the second period before the first supporting cast hero, Wingels, got one past Andrei Vasilevskiy with a perfectly placed slapshot from the top of the left face-off dot. Wingels had jumped onto the ice as part of a line change from something of a broken play to find the puck just sitting there waiting for him; he made no mistake. Tampa Bay entered tonightês game on the second of a back to back and at that precise moment in time, this had the looks of a game the Senators could take control of.  Momentum is funny like that, though: one minute you have it, and the next you donêt. Tampa would control the remainder of the second, and most of the third to be honest, at one point out-shooting Ottawa 23-7 (!) after the Wingels goal. This is when our supporting cast member the second, Condon, really shone.  I could try to describe to you some of the saves that he made to keep the game tied through the end of regulation, but really they would be just words. Words donêt do this type of thing justice: Donêt mind me, Iêm just fanning myself over here. My word. At any rate, the Sens had a fantastic opportunity to win it at the end of regulation with a powerplay for the final two minutes. There were a couple of decent chances, but nothing that required Vasilevskiy to make any spectacular stops.  The Lightning threatened early in overtime, Jonathan Drouin pinged one off the post, and ended it late when Victor Hedman buried a 2 on 1 past a sprawling Condon and ahead of an exhausted Karlsson.  It was a game that felt like some of the others the Sens have _stolenÓ this season on the back of improbable performances from their supporting cast; they just came up a step short this time.  Sens Hero: Mike Condon You saw the videos for yourselves, but Condonês performance tonight was so much more than that. The Lightning were better tonight, plain and simple; Condonês play was a great equalizer.  Sens Killer: Victor Hedman Not only did he pot the overtime winner, but Hedman was a menace all night long. The big defenseman defused rush after rush and created a tonne of offensive chances himself. The Lightningês defense isnêt as deep as it once was, but Victor Hedmanês presence alone makes them competent on the backend.  ",Raw Charge,Tampa Bay defeats Ottawa 2-1 in overtime,"Playing the latter half of a back-to-back against a divisional opponent while on the road is something that has caused Lightning fans a lot of heartache this season. The Lightning have been fighting tooth and nail to claw their way back into the playoff picture after the trade deadline and claw back they have. After a strong performance against the Ottawa Senatorsthe Lightning are now tied with the New York Islanders for the final wild-card spot, though at the moment, the Islanders hold the tiebreaker by virtue of having more ROW wins. This Lightning team didnêt look like they played last night, they had a little pep in their step as they put Ottawa on the back foot early. Brayden Point (bless his Albertan heart) continued his spectacular play since becoming the top center by opening the scoring off a rebound generated by a Jake Dotchin wrist shot that bounced right towards Pointês stick. The rookie has been wonderful for the Lightning all season and has gotten better after every game. The rest of the first period was a lot of back and forth with both teams getting some solid chances, and both Mike Condon and Andrei Vasilevskiy made some impressive saves to keep the game close. Bad luck struck the Lightning early in the second, however, as a clearing attempt by Braydon Coburn hit one of the refereesê skates and tumbled right into the wheelhouse of Tommy Wingels, who proceeded to blast a slap shot past Vasilevskiy to tie the game at one. The Lightning began to control momentum for portions of the second period, but were unable to beat Condon to regain the lead. Ottawa had some chances of their own, but Vasilevskiy stood tall once again to ensure the tie wouldnêt be broken. As the third period progressed both teams continued to have chances with both goaltenders making tremendous saves. Nikita Kucherov had two excellent opportunities in close on Condon, but the Ottawa netminder closed the door. Gabriel Dumont also had an opportunity during a crease scramble, but Condon again made a magnificent toe save to keep the puck out of the net. Aside from the back and forth play nothing of note really stood out in the third until the late penalty for too many men was called and forced the Lightning to finish regulation on a nerve-wracking penalty kill. The Lightning PK did a good job at limiting Ottawaês chances, but Zack Smithês wrister from the slot caused a small uptick in my heart rate that I was not prepared for. Luckily Vasilevskiy saved it to ensure the Bolts would get at least one point. A peculiar thing occurred at the start of overtime. Jon Cooper started the line of Point, Kucherov, and Victor Hedman, which is something he doesnêt normally do until the latter part of the extra period. The pace of the overtime was as quick as youêd expect between these two teams with both clubs trading chances. Ottawa and Tampa Bay both were credited with only three shots during overtime, however, Hedman was able to seal the extra point as he tapped in a puck after Ondrej Palat fed him a beautiful pass across the slot that went between the legs of Derick Brassard.  Since the trade deadline, the Tampa Bay Lightning have gone 6-1-1 and are tied for the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference. Since Florida routed the Toronto Maple Leafs this evening, the Thursday night game becomes one of the biggest games of the season. Toronto sits one point behind the Lightning, and a win Thursday would give Tampa Bay a three-point cushion on their divisional rival, which would only strengthen their playoff chances. A loss doesnêt completely kill the Lightningês playoff hopes, but it will only make the remaining schedule even more strenuous.  This team believes in themselves folks, weêve gotta ride this whether they succeed or fail.  "

Darling made 33 saves and Richard Panik scored the tiebreaking goal late in the third period to lift the Blackhawks over Condon and the Senators 2-1. Panik beat Condon on the power play at 16:59 of the third, finding the back of the net on a one-timer off a feed from Patrick Kane, who was behind the net. ""It's fun.

Condon made 26 saves for the Senators, who failed to jump into first place in the Atlantic Division. Kyle Turris scored the lone goal. Keith opened the scoring 8:04 into the third period. Condon made the initial save on the shot but the rebound bounced off a collection of bodies in front of the net before crossing the goal line. ""I thought the rebound was going far right so I tried to extend, then it hit a skate and went the other way,"" Condon said. ""I tried to lay back and cover it up, but the guy tapped it in. "" Turris tied the game at 11:23 on the power play with a one-timer from the right side that beat a screened Darling over the shoulder with Bobby Ryanon top of the crease. ""It was good to take advantage of an opportunity there. I was just trying to get the puck through because we've been struggling on the (power play),"" Turris said. ""It's a frustrating result. I thought we played a pretty solid, structured game, it just got away at the end there. "" Neither team was able to score despite firing 43 combined shots on goal through two periods. The Senators had 21 shots on Darling through the first two periods but another 23 were blocked by Blackhawks skaters. Condon made 22 saves while his teammates blocked 10 additional shots. condon 's best save was a glove grab against Artemi Panarin in the second after Senators forward Derick Brassard tried to clear the puck behind the goal but it bounced off the side of the net right to Panarin in the slot. ""There wasn't much of back and forth and it was kind of a weird game. It seemed slow and boring in a lot of ways,"" Keith said. The Senators had back-to-back power plays late in the second as Marian Hossa was called for holding just eight seconds after Marcus Kruger finished serving his interference penalty. Ottawa had two shots on each of those power plays with no luck. Cody Cecihad no luck either as he was staring at a wide-open net from the face-off circle but the puck jumped over his stick.

",Adnan,Senators lose 2-1 to the Blackhawks on a late goal,"The 69th game of the season did not have a nice ending for the Ottawa Senators. The Senators were close to picking up at least the point they needed to head to the Atlantic Division summit. But a pair of ill-advised slashing penalties at the end of the game proved to be too much to overcome as Richard Panik scored a power play goal with 3:01 remaining to give Chicago the win. The Senators had a disappointing loss to Tampa Bay on Tuesday but more than held their own in the first period, ending it even on shots at 13-13 and ahead 31-23 on shot attempts. For the third time in four periods, Ottawa failed to score and went into the intermission level at 0-0. The game tightened up in the second period with fewer scoring chances. With Mark Stone missing and the backup goalie in net, Guy Boucher appeared to have the Senators playing even more defensively than usual and it did work for the first 40 minutes. There were few high end chances although Bobby Ryan did have a fantastic opportunity to score the opening goal but the puck bounced over his stick while all alone and with an empty net to shoot at. With almost half the third period gone, the game was still scoreless until Duncan Keith's slapshot was stopped by Mike Condon but went off multiple Senators players and back into their own net. The Senators responded soon after though, with Ryan providing a screen and Kyle Turris' shot blowing by Scott Darling on the power play to tie the game at one. Ottawa had tilted the play towards the Chicago end and looked good value for at least a point. However, with 5:45 remaining in the game, Derick Brassard broke John Hayden's stick with a slash. With 23 seconds still remaining on that penalty, Marc Methot broke Marian Hossa's stick to put Ottawa down two men. While Ottawa would kill off the 5-on-3, with about a minute left on Methot's penalty, Patrick Kane made a brilliant pass from behind the net to Panik and the shot gave Condon no time to react. The Senators did have another late chance to tie the game, but with Ryan having another semi-empty net to shoot at, his stick was tied up and he couldn't get the shot off. The game finished as a frustrating loss for Ottawa, with a chance to go top of the division squandered and ended their run of points in seven straight games. Sens Hero: Kyle Turris He scored the only game for Ottawa, and had a great play at the end to give Ryan a chance to tie it again. He had three shots on the night and won 13 out of 18 face-offs. Honourable Mention: Mike Condon. The Senators actually did a good job defensively and Condon stopped what he should have. Stopping 26 out of 28 shots is always a solid performance in the NHL. Coming up: The home-and-home with the Canadiens! The Senators are a point back of the Habs with a game in hand. The two clubs will play on Saturday and Sunday this weekend and again on the Saturday the following weekend.

Senators goaltender Mike Condon made the initial stop, but the puck rolled into the net after bouncing off a defenderês skate as rookie Nick Schmaltz pressured the net. The goal was reviewed by the league, but was called a good goal. Kyle Turris evened the game with a power-play goal at 11:23 off a one-timer feed from Erik Karlsson to make it 1-1. With the Hawks pushing the tempo, Panik answered with a goal on the man advantage to avoid overtime.  Darling made the start due to Corey Crawford being ill. The Lemont, Ill. native made 33 saves to improve his record to 17-5-2 this season. At the other end, Condon was also filling in for a starter - Craig Anderson (lower-body, day-to-day). Condon stopped 26 of 28 shots for the Senators.  John Hayden had one shot on goal in 8:44 of ice time in his NHL debut. The Hawks 2013 third-round pick, who signed a two-year deal earlier this week, was thrust into the lineup due to Artem Anisimovês injury. With Anisimov out for three to four weeks, Schmaltz moved down to center the second line while Hayden manned the left wing role on the top line.

However, they know they need to be ready to face a hungry Senatars team again at home in less than 24 hours. Paul Byron and Alexander Radulov scored in the tiebreaker to give the Canadiens a 4-3 victory Saturday night in the first half of the teams' home-and-home set. Montreal moved two points ahead of Ottawa atop the Atlantic Division. ""We worked hard, we earned that second point,"" the Canadiens' Brendan Gallagher said. ""We both want to climb in the standings, it's so tight. They're right behind us and these are two big games this weekend. It's a huge win for us. ""There's a little bit of hatred, a lot of respect and the compete level and the battle level between the two teams is high. ... It's the same thing every single time you play them, you better be prepared to work or you're not going to get the result you want. "" Andrew Shaw, Philip Danault and Gallagher scored in regulation for Montreal, and Carey Price finished with 28 saves. Much has been made of the matchups this weekend, but Ottawa coach Guy Boucher did his best to downplay the hype. ""This is exciting, but that's not the NHL playoffs. It's an important game for points, just like tomorrow's going to be an important game and Boston's going to be an important game. It's not about first place, it's get in, wherever, against whoever and be ready. Right now it's such a tough fight.

There had been some debate in the morning as to who would start in goal for the Senators as it was uncertain whether Anderson was fit to play. ""I felt I was healed enough to go out there and felt good enough to go play,"" Anderson said after the game. Boucher said he has no issue playing Anderson again on Sunday as long as he feels good enough. The Senators had a chance to win in overtime when Max Pacioretty took a penalty, but were unable to capitalize on the power play. ""When you're able to kill that penalty you gain some confidence going into the shootout,"" Montreal coach Claude Julien said. ""The guys were on a high, Carey gave us two big saves and I think you saw Radulov and Byron riding that high. "" Trailing 2-1 to start the third, the Canadiens scored twice within 31 seconds. Danault tied the game as he was able to beat Anderson through the legs at the 6:15 mark - it was Montreal's first shot of the period despite having just come off a power play. Then, Gallagher gave the Canadiens the lead, beating Anderson over the shoulder from a sharp angle. ""(Gallagher's shot) got the top of my pad and went in,"" Anderson said. ""You could do that play over and over again and 99 times it won't go in. We'll look at it and have to learn from that and make sure we seal the net there on the edge. "" With just under five minutes remaining Karlsson tied the game with a shot from the point. ""(Karlsson) and our guys stepped up to the plate and bounced back for me,"" Anderson said. Montreal opened the scoring at the two-minute mark of the second period after a defensive breakdown by Ottawa that allowed Danault to find Shaw all alone at the side of the net. The Canadiens took advantage of the momentum and held the edge in play until the Senators tied things with a power-play goal with 7:24 to go in the period as Kyle Turris found Brassard streaking through the slot and was able to beat Price stick side. Just over a minute later, Dzingel gave the Senators the lead as he battled for the puck at the side of the net and was able to squeeze it behind Price. ""We had a little sequence where we were dominated by the Senators, but we were able to regroup,"" said Julien. ""We came back in the third and scored twice to regain the lead. You expect these kinds of things in a game. "" NOTES: Ottawa D Mark Borowiecki was back in the lineup after missing the last four games with a lower-body injury. ... Senators RW Mark Stone remains sidelined with a lower-body injury, missing his fourth straight game. ... Montreal D Alexei Emelin, LW Andreas Martinsen and RW Michael McCarronwere healthy scratches. UP NEXT Canadiens: Host Ottawa on Sunday night in the opener of a six-game homestand. Senators: At Montreal on Sunday night to start a stretch of seven of eight on the road.   ",Ary M,"Habs stay on top of the Atlantic, down Sens 4-3 in SO","Iêm glad that this wasnêt a playoff game because if it was, Iêd be bitter. Ups-and-downs, shady penalty calls, a botched late-game powerplay, and a weak goal means that the game   and the Atlantic Division lead   was well in sight for the Ottawa Senators tonight. However, it just wasnêt meant to be.  Tonight had many of the key ingredients that weêve come to expect from a Habs - Sens matchup. The first sign? A high-pace. The scoreless first period was due to the efforts of Carey Price and Craig Anderson, not because there was a shortage of chances. Bobby Ryan and Jean-Gabriel Pageau were especially noticeable for the Senators, while Shaw, Lekhonen, Byron, and Gallagher were all seen around Craig Andersonês crease, jamming away for any loose pucks.  The second period also started off wild, mainly due to the way the first period ended with sequential penalties to Mark Borowiecki and Phillip Danault. After Turris beat Price but hit the post on the Sens short powerplay opportunity, Danault raced out of the box for a partial breakaway only to miss the net going high on Anderson. However, the Habs forward would get the last laugh. On his next shift, the Habs dumped the puck in and pressed two forwards in on a 2-1-2 forecheck. Alex Burrows and Cody Ceci both misplay the dump, leading to the puck bouncing out in front of Anderson and right to Danault. Instead of forcing a shot, he finds a wide-open Andrew Shaw for a tap-in to put the Habs up 1-0.   The first 10 minutes of the period was all Montreal, with Ott, Lekhonen, and Plekanec all having Grade-A opportunities on Craig Anderson and outshooting the Sens 9-3. Iêd imagine that Boucher noticed this, as he switches up his D pairings, putting Methot with Cody Ceci and Dion Phaneuf with Erik Karlsson (as you can see visually in the image below via ShiftChart where the red blocks represent shifts by the Sens). Ottawaês luck changes quickly, with the aforementioned Methot drawing a tripping penalty on Danault in the offensive zone. The Sens cash in on what first appears to be a broken play, but ends up manifesting as a quick-strike scoring chance. As Erik Karlsson is forced out into the neutral zone by a Habs PKer, he transitions the puck to Mike Hoffman on the right wall for the entry. Hoffman quickly fires it cross ice to Kyle Turris, who then lobs the puck to a streaking Derick Brassard down the middle of the ice. Brassard beautifully taps the puck out of the air to tie the game at 1 on his 13th of the year.   Less than two minutes later, the Sens take the lead. Ryan Dzingel, playing in his 100th NHL game, pokes a puck through Carey Price as he and Alex Burrows were crashing the net for a loose puck that Karlsson sent there from his favourite Çforwardê position on the right side. Itês a weak goal on Price, but one that Dzingel will take in order to break a slump for his 14th of the season. The shots, lopsided in favour of the Habs originally, ended up being 12-10 OTT, showcasing the changing tides nicely.  Unfortunately for the Senators, their one-goal lead evaporated quickly in the third period. The momentum swing started with a Brassard slashing penalty on Andrew Shaw 5-minutes in. A soft call by Tim Peel (duh!), but a bad penalty to take nonetheless given that Brassard was 140 feet away from his own net. On the PK, the Sens do well to clog the neutral zone and stymie the Habs until... the very end of the powerplay. As the Sens try to sneak a D pairing line change in, Andrew Shaw turns at the high point and sends the puck to Nathan Beaulieu, who fires it on net. Of course, Phillip Danault is waiting their for the rebound to knot the game at 2 on an even-strength goal just as time expired.  Less than a minute later, Brendan Gallagher spins off of Dion Phaneuf near the goal line on the left side of the ice and picks the top right corner on Anderson. Itês a shaky goal that Anderson would love back, especially seeing that it was one of the furthest shot attempts the Habs had all night.  After taking the lead, the Habs try to slow down the pace of play and are successful in the first 10 minutes   with the shot count favouring them, 3-2. However, the tide turns as the Sens build momentum off of won offensive zone draws and set offensive zone plays. Soon after, Zack Smith draws a hooking call on Jeff Petry and on the ensuing advantage, Karlsson hits the post while Hoffman and Turris hit... Bobby Ryan in front. Ryan, who was shaken up after the powerplay, stayed in the game and was extremely noticeable tonight with 9 shot attempts, a couple of nice scoring chances, and a 57% CF%.  The Sens finally tie the game up off of a face-off play executed to perfection. It starts with Brassard winning the draw cleanly to Marc Methot on the left wall, who then tees the puck up perfectly for Karlsson on the left point. From there, the Captain just does his thing   firing an accurate wrist shot through 4 players (including the net front presence of Alex Burrows) and past Carey Price to make it 3-all.   Given the division title at stake, I was surprised to see that both teams fought valiantly at the end of the period to try and win the game in regulation, with the dangerous Lekhonen - Shaw - Danault line pinning the Sens fourth line in the zone for a minute while Hoffman - Turris - Ryan countered for the Senators. In 3-on-3 OT, most of the action came before the Sens putrid 4-on-3 attempt in the final two minutes, where the team was way too intentional with looking for slow cross-ice passes and didnêt manage a single scoring chance on the Habs.  The Habs walked away with the two points after Paul Byron and Alexander Radulov both scored on Craig Anderson while Bobby Ryan and Kyle Turris were unable to score for Ottawa.  Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson I really wanted the team to score on the 4-on-3 in OT, not just for the two points, but for Karlsson to add a third point to his collection on the night. The captain continued to lead by example, and was on the ice for all of the Sens goals while hitting a post and drawing two penalties (high-stick on Danault and holding on Pacioretty in OT).  Sens Killers: Habs Depth The line of Lekhonen, Shaw, and Danault were nefarious all night long and were the main creators of offence for the Habs. They had >65% of the shot attempts on the ice and ran amok despite who was on the ice for Ottawa. Slick, fast, and skilled   when the teams meet tomorrow, Boucher and co. will be looking for a unit to get the puck out of the zone quickly when this trio is on the ice. With Jean-Gabriel Pageau occupied with the Alex Galchenyuk matchup, either the Turris or Brassard lines will have to take on this duty.  Sens Killer: Defensive Breakdowns Present less so this season compared to seasons past, Guy Boucher canêt be happy with his teamês defensive effort tonight. The third goal was completely on Anderson, but the Sens netminder had to battle in his crease all night long due to the number of shot attempts in tight by the Habs, which you can see on the heat map below. There were also a number of lapses in defensive coverage   two of them leading to goals against   and a number of others that led to key stops on Alexander Radulov and Max Pacioretty. Itês hard to say what the cause is, but it just seemed like the Sens had both a hard time supporting each other in the defensive zone AND made a couple of bad line changes.  ",Eyes on the Prize,Staying on top of the Atlantic,"The Montreal Canadiens headed to the Canadian Tire Centre to solidify their perch atop the Atlantic Division. Separated by just a single point from the Ottawa Senators with the top spot still on the line, coach Claude Julien shook up his defence pairings. Nathan Beaulieu drew back into the lineup, while Alexei Emelin was made a healthy scratch. The opening period was a fast and chippy affair, with the Canadiens quickly finding their feet early on. Despite the recent history of bad blood between the two clubs, the referees saw fit to let both teams play it out. Though Montreal peppered Craig Andersonwith more shots than Ottawa managed on Price, neither team was able to break the deadlock. After nearly lasting an entire period without drawing a penalty, Mark Borowieckiwas sent off for high-sticking Max Pacioretty. Montreal lasted less than a minute on the man advantage, before a questionable slashing call went against Phillip Danault.  Four-on-four hockey didnêt produce any goals and as the period came to an end, with the Canadiens headed back to locker room to prepare for a brief upcoming penalty kill. Heading into the second down a man, the Canadiens successfully weathered a shortened Senators power play that saw a dangerous shot from Kyle Turris ring off the post. As the penalty expired, Danault got a great opportunity to put his club on the board first, but Anderson denied his breakaway attempt to keep it a scoreless game.  Danault would get another chance, when he took advantage of Artturi Lehkonenês tenacious forecheck to find Andrew Shaw alone in front of the Senatorsê net. Shaw made no mistake, putting the puck into the open net to score his 11th of the season and give Montreal the first lead in the game less than three minutes into the second. But Danaultês tripping penalty on a defensive lunge at the puck over halfway through the period sent the Ottawa Senators back on the power play. Derick Brassard wristed one past Price on the resulting man advantage to knot the game at one apiece. Just over a minute later, the Senators parlayed that momentum into their first lead of the game, when Ryan Dzingelês harmless-looking shot hit Priceês skate and slid to the back of the net. Undeterred, the Canadiens went into the final frame looking for a tying goal, and just over six minutes in they found it. Danault got his second dose of redemption as he pulled a sweet deke to fool Anderson and tie the game at two. Linemates Lehkonen and Shaw grabbed helpers on Danaultês 11th goal of the season. Less then a minute later, Brendan Gallagher restored Montrealês lead. Gallagher outworked Senators defender Dion Phaneuf to take a tight-angle shot that found the back of the net. Spurred by the lead change, the Senators started amping up pressure in the Canadiensê end throughout the rest of the period. Ottawaês persistence led to a power play opportunity halfway through the frame when Brandon Davidson got two minutes for hooking.  Though Turris rang another puck off the post on the resulting man advantage, the Senators were more adept at hitting Bobby Ryan, who acted as an extra penalty killer for the Canadiens. Thanks to his assistance, Montreal escaped unscathed. But a regulation win slipped through the hands of the Canadiens, when Erik Karlsson beat Price to knot the game at three. Despite the best efforts of the Lehkonen-Danault-Shaw line in the dying minutes of the third, the game was sent to overtime. Neither team was able to muster scoring chances in extra time. A late holding call that went against Pacioretty allowed the Senators to ice an extra skater until time ran out. But the Canadiens penalty kill was up for the challenge and managed to get the game to a shootout. Ottawa sent Bobby Ryan out first and he rang his shot off the post. Montreal sent out Paul Byron, who beat Anderson cleanly. The Senators responded with Kyle Turris who failed to get the puck past Price for the third time in the game. The Canadiens answered with Alex Radulov, who buried his attempt and the Ottawa Senators in the process. Thoughts The Lehkonen-Danault-Shaw combination was Montrealês best line in this game. The trio combined to put up two goals and five points on the night and the Canadiens controlled over 64% of even-strength shot attempts while they were on the ice. A combination of relentless forechecking, short passes and a nose for getting to the net produced several great scoring chances throughout the game. And despite the two questionable penalties assessed to Danault, both Lehkonen and more notably Shaw remained disciplined (with Shaw even going on to draw a penalty in the third). Both Beaulieu and Jordie Benn ended up being the Canadiensê top defencemen in this game. Montreal controlled over 65% of even-strength shot attempts while Beaulieu was on the ice and over 62% of even-strength shot attempts while Benn was on. If anything, Beaulieu has given enough of a reason in this game to remain in the lineup over Emelin for at least a couple more games.  This Canadiens donêt really have anything to lose in this division battle. The tight race for top spot in the Atlantic will give them plenty of practice for the gruelling nature of the playoffs. If the Senators do manage to grab first place in the division, they will need to face a strong New York Rangers club that has been muscled out of the Metro, but one that the Habs have handled recently if they are to hang on to top spot. New York and Ottawa have only met once in the playoffs, and the Rangers came out ahead. It would also set up a rivalry-renewing first-round series between the Boston Bruins and the Habs   and who doesnêt want to see these two clubs to meet in the post-season?  "

Price made 30 saves for his 33rd win of the season and the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Ottawa Senators 4-1 on Sunday night to sweep the home-and-home series. With Montreal leading 2-1 in the second, Price was at his best when Kyle Turris fired a one-timer that appeared headed for the back of the net. But the Canadiens goalie sprang to his right and did the splits to get his toe on the puck. ""That's just fun to watch,"" teammate Jordie Benn said of Price's save. ""If I did that I'd blow my hamstrings off. He's an amazing goalie. He's there to save us. "" Benn, Tomas Plekanec, Paul Byron and Nathan Beaulieu scored for the Canadiens, who lead the Atlantic Division by four points over the Senators, who still have one game in hand. Tom Pyatt scored a first-period goal for the Senators. Craig Andersonstopped 33 shots. The Canadiens also beat the Senators in Ottawa on Saturday, winning 4-3 in a shootout. Price made 28 saves in that game, while Anderson stopped 29 shots in defeat. ""It's very upsetting to lose to Montreal two days in a row, but they played well and showed they are a quality team,"" Senators captain Erik Karlssonsaid. ""They executed really well on the back-to-back and we couldn't do the same. "" The Senators have lost four games in a row after winning six straight to start the month. Ottawa and Montreal face off once more before the end of the season: next Saturday at the Bell Centre. ""These were fun games to play, even though we were on the losing side,"" Karlsson said. ""We learned a great deal from it. We're going to figure this out. There are no worries. Hopefully by next Saturday we have something new to throw at them. "" With Montreal leading 2-1 in the third period Sunday, Byron made it a two-goal lead for the Canadiens when he went five-hole on Anderson at 3:30, opting to shoot while on a 2-on-1 with Plekanec. The goal was Byron's 20th of the season. He also added an assist on Montreal's first goal of the game. ""It was pretty special,"" Byron said. ""I didn't think I would be a 20-goal scorer in the NHL. I've come a long way to reach that. It's definitely a special moment. My wife and kids are here in the rink, so it's pretty cool for them to see. "" Beaulieu made in 4-1, on the power play, scoring with a slap shot from the blue line with Anderson screened by Artturi Lekhonen at 5:08. Montreal is now 8-4-2 in the second game of a back-to-back. The Senators are 6-4-1. Sunday's game had big playoff implications, and the energy on the ice and atmosphere in the stands were definitely playoff-like. Montreal came out flying, only needing 28 seconds to get the sell-out crowd off its feet. Plekanec scored his first goal since Jan. 24 when Andrei Markov's shot from the point bounced off anderson 's chest and fell right to the veteran center in the crease for his eighth of the season. The lead was short-lived as Pyatt scored the equalizer at 4:36 of the first when his shot from close range deflected off Benn's stick and skipped over Price's outstretched pad. Benn made up for the mistake later in the same period when his shot from the point deflected off Viktor Stalberg's stick to beat Anderson glove side at 17:45. NOTES: Price only faced six shots in the second period, but needed to be at his best when Kyle Turris fired a one-timer. The Canadiens goalie sprang to his right and did the splits to get his toe on the puck. ... Montreal's Alexei Emelin was back in the lineup after he was a healthy scratch in Ottawa. ... The Canadiens are 10-4-0 under Claude Julien. ... Torrey Mitchell played his 600th NHL game. UP NEXT Senators: at Boston on Tuesday night. Canadiens: host Detroit on Tuesday night.  ",Ross A,Sens fall to Habs in lopsided loss,"I have some good news and bad news. The bad news is that the Senators were badly outplayed by the Canadiens, and if this is a playoff preview, the Sens will be in tough. The good news is that Mark Stone is injured, and his return would push nearly everyone down in the lineup, giving Ottawa a much better team. The only problem is that this shows just how dependent Ottawa is on having all of their best players healthy. What happens if Kyle Turris or Mike Hoffman or, dare I say it, Erik Karlsson arenêt good to go in the playoffs? Itês an ugly future I hope we donêt face. The first period of the game was actually pretty even. It also saw the first three goals of the game come. Tomas Plekanec opened the scoring just 28 seconds in, off a rebound in close. It didnêt look promising. Thankfully, Tom Pyatt tied it up four minutes later. His shot hit Jordie Benn in tight and deflected over Carey Priceês shoulder. Benn would make it up though with a hard slapshot from the point to restore the Canadiensê lead. That would do it for the first. I remember very little of the second period, other than that it didnêt look good for Ottawa at all. The final shot count was 15-6 for the Habs. You wouldêve been forgiven for forgetting these teams played each other last night, since only one had any energy. The third period had three distinct phases: disappointment, dispute, and dejection. Sens fans were initially pretty happy, when the Habs appeared to have scored (at least to Bob Cole) but video review confirmed that the puck wedged under Craig Andersonês pad and didnêt seem to cross the line. That quickly gave way though when Paul Byron snapped home his 20th (!!) of the year on a 2-on-1 on which Erik Karlsson played the pass, but Anderson tried to as well. 3-1 wasnêt insurmountable, but it seemed harder than 2-1. That initial disappointment gave way to disputes, with a number of fisticuffs breaking out between these teams. Zack Smith tousled with Alexander Radulov and Mark Borowiecki went after Jordie Benn. Shortly after, Chris Kelly and Torrey Mitchell went around in circles with the gloves off. Bobby Ryan also tried to join in, by going after Alexei Emelin, but the refs gave Ryan the only penalty. That penalty led to dejection. On the powerplay, Nathan Beaulieu got one to go home from the point, all but sealing Ottawaês fate. Just a few seconds after the faceoff, the Habs raced in again and Byron snapped another one home, but a coachês challenge proved successful and offside was found to have occurred on the play. Though the goal didnêt count, it might as well have, because Ottawa seemed to do nothing for the rest of the game. They decided to lick their wounds and go home, now nursing a four-game losing streak on the heels of their six-game win streak. Dishonourable Mention: Marc Methot and Mark Borowiecki Ottawaês defence corps as a whole didnêt do well on the night, but these two stood out to me in particular as being caught out of position and having lapses on the back.  ",Eyes on the Prize,Once More with Feeling,"After a hard-fought shootout victory, the Montreal Canadiens tinkered with their lineup, adding Michael McCarron and Alexei Emelin in place of Steve Ott and Brandon Davidson. Carey Price got the start, and the Hometown Hockey crowd was treated to the dulcet tones of Bob Cole. The Habs got off to a lightning quick start, as Tomas Plekanec tipped the puck past Craig Anderson 28 seconds into the game. Mere moments later, their hot start continued, as Mike Hoffman took an interference call against Alex Galchenyuk. Montreal continued to buzz, with Andrew Shaw getting a gorgeous chance, as the Habs continued to outhustle and outwork the Sens. Unfortunately, despite the Canadiensê momentum, Tom Pyatt scored a fluky goal, tying it 1-1 at 4:36. The Sens snatched the momentum after that, drawing a penalty of their own. However, the Canadiens got two short-handed breakaways, one from Phillip Danault and one from Paul Byron, as the momentum swung back in the Habsê favour, holding Ottawa to zero shots on goal. The Habs largely continued to play well through a 4-on-4, but Jordie Benn took a penalty for defending Carey Price when Chris Kelly went into him. The Senatorsê power play was a disaster, and the Habs strong short-handed play gave them a boost. With 2:15 left to go in the period, the Canadiens capitalized on their pressure, as Benn scored on a gorgeous one-timer. After 20, the Habs led 2-1, and the shots were a close 13-12 for the Canadiens. The Senators got the better of the first part of the second frame, keeping the Habs running around with a strong forecheck.  About halfway through the period, Galchenyuk, Radulov, and Pacioretty got the Habs going as all three got chances on Anderson. The terrific shift sparked off a prolonged stint in the offensive zone that saw good shifts from the third line and fourth lines, and a great shot from Nathan Beaulieu.  With 7:40 to go in the frame, the Habs were outshooting the Sens 10-3 in the second, and had once again taken over the momentum.  Kyle Turris threatened to tie the game with about three minutes left in the period, but Price turned the puck aside, to a thunderous ovation from the Bell Centre faithful. Ottawa generated some push-back, but the period ended with Montreal outshooting Ottawa 29-19. Moreover, they were out-chancing the Sens as well.  The Canadiens got off to a good start in he third, as Michael McCarron got a beautiful backhand chance on Anderson. There was a brief moment when the Habs thought they might have scored, but the goal was vehemently waived off on the ice, and a quick video review showed that the puck under Andersonês pad had never crossed the line.  There was no question about goal or no goal, however, when Byron put the puck past Anderson with authority to give the Habs the 3-1 lead. Gallagher got the assist after taking a hit to make the pass to the now-20-goal-scorer. They kept their foot on the pedal, and at about the 11-minute mark, Zack Smith and Alexander Radulov got into a shoving match as Radulov objected to Smithês putting him into the boards by the bench. A crowd gathered, and Radulov, Benn, Smith, and Mark Borowiecki all got two minutes for roughing. Things continued to escalate   as they almost inevitably do against Ottawa   when Torrey Mitchell and Chris Kelly dropped the gloves after Mitchell objected to being knocked over. It didnêt get a whole lot better when Bobby Ryan stapled Radulov without the puck, and Pacioretty grabbed Ryan as the crowd gathered. Ryan took an interference penalty on the play and Nathan Beaulieu put a rocket through Anderson. Scarcely had the puck dropped when Gallagher set up Byron directly off the faceoff a mere six seconds later. Unfortunately, Byron was the victim of the skate-off-the-ice offside review, so the goal was called back. The Senators tried to get something going after that, but Price remained stellar, and the Habs picked up a convincing 4-1 win, and big two points to pad their division lead. Thoughts Andrew Shaw had a very good outing. No nonsense play, and several really good chances over the course of the game are pretty much everything one would want from him. He continues to be a very effective player under Julien, which is certainly encouraging. Paul Byron is the gift that just keeps on giving. Twenty goals, 17 assists, a multi-point game, and a real threat in just about every situation.  Brendan Gallagherês luck has turned, methinks. The goal Saturday night, a gorgeous assist last night, an overall strong game with unquestionably the best line of the game, and boy is it about time. Carey Price. That save. ÇNuff said. Alexei Emelin looked better than he had the last time he played, especially on the hit on Karlsson at about the 11-minute mark in the third. But better is still not necessarily good. Nathan Beaulieu had a goal and an assist, and should never be benched again. Also Petry-Beaulieu on the power play is a thing of beauty that needs happen far more regularly.  "
72,1 Regular,3/21/2017,7:00 PM,A,Boston Bruins,3,2,W,,40,24,8,W 1,22,10,1,5,0,36,12,2,5,0,"17,565",2:37,"Turris scores 2, Senators beat Bruins 3-2 to end 4-game skid","For the Ottawa Senators, snapping a four-game losing streak seemed almost secondary to the way they did it. The Senators appeared ready for a return to the playoffs, ending an untimely skid with a 3-2 victory over the Boston Bruins on Tuesday night. ""We wanted to see this as a seventh game because we want to be able to manage pressure,"" coach Guy Boucher said. ""We've got a lot of young guys in there - a lot of guys who haven't gone to the playoffs in the NHL and had a lot of pressure moments. "" The Senators were in an 0-2-2 slump and facing a team that could have pulled within two points of them for second place in the Atlantic Division. Instead, they headed home with a six-point cushion on the Bruins and a building sense of confidence. Kyle Turris scored twice and Craig Anderson made 33 saves as the Senators improved to 3-0 against Boston this season. Tom Pyatt also scored and Mike Hoffman had two assists for Ottawa, which won despite being outshot 36-22. Anderson stymied Boston with 18 saves in the second period, then again in the third after Torey Krug tied it for the Bruins just 17 seconds into the period. Turris restored the lead a few minutes later and Ottawa never flinched as the Bruins pressed to keep their own losing streak from reaching three straight. ""I liked our third period. I thought our third period was good,"" Boucher said. ""The minute we scored that goal, after that we looked like ourselves. We looked in control of where we were defensively. When we had the puck we had more poise. We gained that over the course of the game. "" Krug had a goal and an assist, and David Krejci also scored in Boston's third consecutive defeat. The Bruins were coming off a 4-2 loss at Toronto on Monday night and never recovered from a flat start at home Tuesday. The Bruins remained in playoff position, third in the division with nine games to play, but missed out on another chance to widen their lead over the pack of teams pushing for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference. ""We know where we are at this point of the year. Points are huge and teams are going to show up and be ready to play us,"" center Patrice Bergeron said. The Bruins faced another round of questions about fading down the stretch and missing the playoffs the last two years. Could it happen again?""There's a lot of guys in that room who weren't here last year, myself included,"" said interim coach Bruce Cassidy, who is 12-6-0 since replacing Claude Julien in early February. ""We'd like to write our own story. "" Even with the sluggish start, the game did have a little bit of a playoff feel to it. Both teams were physical all night, with several hits after the whistle and some more pushing and shoving after the final horn. The officials separated the players before the postgame scrum turned into anything more. ""It was just one of those games where both teams are fighting for their playoff lives and that just made for a hard, gritty, hard-nosed hockey game,"" Anderson said. ""They were crashing the net hard. We were crashing their net, getting traffic and momentum as we were going back and forth. You know, it was just one of those games where tempers start to go and emotions get involved and guys care. "" Early in the third, Krug took the puck end-to-end and skated through a pair of Senators before beating Anderson for an unassisted power-play goal. The Bruins opened the period with the man advantage after Dion Phaneuf was called for unsportsmanlike conduct at the end of the second following scrums among several players on the ice. Phaneuf made up for his mistake later in the third with an assist on Turris' game-winner. Turris tipped a shot by Phaneuf and the puck changed direction again when it hit Boston captain Zdeno Chara on its way to the back of the net. NOTES: The Senators return to Boston on April 6 for the fourth and final meeting of the regular season. ... Anderson played his 499th career game. ... Senators C Chris Kelly played his first game in Boston since breaking his leg as a member of the Bruins on Nov. 3, 2015, keeping him out for the rest of last season. ... Ottawa RW Mark Stone missed his sixth straight game with a leg injury but has resumed skating and is getting closer to returning, Boucher said. ... Boston LW Tim Schaller (lower-body injury) missed his sixth consecutive game. UP NEXT Senators: Back home Thursday against Pittsburgh, then on the road for five straight. Bruins: Host the Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday night.  ",Colin4000,"Kyle Turris scores twice, Ottawa Senators beat Boston Bruins 3-2","After dropping their last four straight, the Ottawa Senators looked to rebound against a hot Boston Bruins team that had gone 4-2 in their last six games. Boston, coming off a dramatic 4-2 loss to the Leafs last night, came up short in a valiant effort. Ottawa had the upper hand tonight, grabbing the victory by a score of 3-2. The Bruins dominated the start of the game, with Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand showing off their chemistry. Holding Marchand off the scoresheet would be a key part to the Sensê triumph, ending his four-game point streak (with ten points in that span).  Ottawa would obtain the first goal, however, as a shot by Cody Ceci from the point would deflect off of Tom Pyatt past Tuukka Rask. The game was going in the right direction already, as the Sens hold a league-best .813 win percentage when scoring first. The Sens would get a couple power play chances in the period as well, although we all know how those turn out. Both would generate nothing, with each being cancelled out sooner or later by an Ottawa penalty (one of which was for too-many-men, our league-high 12th bench minor of the season). Boston would tie the game on the second ensuing power play, as David Krejciripped a shot low-blocker from the point. A screened Anderson had barely any chance on the play. Period two would be filled with special teams. The first opportunity would go to Ottawa, who to the surprise of many, scored! Kyle Turris would blaze a one-timer towards the net, which would beat Rask and give the Sens the lead a minute and a half in. Ottawa would go to the power play again a short while later, but failed to get their second power play goal of the game. After some great chances at both ends and some amazing saves by Craig Anderson, the tilt remained 2-1. Jump to the end of the frame, and Cody Ceci and Frank Vatrano would get offsetting minors during a scuffle to put the game at 4-on-4. Phaneuf would then take an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for provoking Torey Krug, sending Boston to start the third period at 4-on-3.  On a side note, Phaneuf is second in the league in minor penalties this season, heading to the box 37 times. Should he hit the 42 heês currently on pace for, it will be the most from a Sens player since Jarkko Ruurtu had 47 in 2008-09. Heading out fresh for a full two minutes on the power play, it wouldnêt take the Bruins long to find the back of the net. Torey Krug would make a nifty end-to-end play, dancing past Pageau, Karlsson and Methot before beating Craig Anderson with his wrist shot. The goal came seventeen seconds into the third period, evening the game at two apiece. Ottawa would answer by getting some extended time in the offensive zone, leading to Kyle Turrisê second goal of the game, a tip off a Phaneuf shot from the point. The tally would distance Turris for Ottawaês goal scoring lead, bringing himself to one away from his career high (26 in 2013-14).  Mark Borowiecki would go to the box for holding, but the penalty kill would come up big to preserve the one-goal lead. Rask would race to the bench for the extra attacker, although the Sens would fend off some scary chances to close out the win.  Sens Hero: Kyle Turris Add another two to the goal column for Turris. He led the Sens with five shots on goal, and was one of three Ottawa players to finish with an above-50 CF%. It was his sixth game winning goal of the season, which matches his career-high in 2014-15. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson After coming off two disappointing back-to-back starts against the Canadiens, it was great to see Andy back in good form. He made plenty of key saves, including robbing Noel Acciari with his quick glove.  Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman Hoffman got the secondary assist on the Sensê first two goals, increasing his offensive output to 14 points in his last 13 games. His game has found a whole new level recently. Sens Zero: Ryan Dzingel He was shortened to only 6:19 of 5v5 play, the lowest of either team tonight. His demotion to play with Kelly and Wingels isnêt a good sign either, as the speedster has been struggling mightily as of late. He couldnêt muster anything tonight either, finishing with a 0% CF% (zero attempts for, six against). Sens Killer: Torey Krug Krug amassed seven shots on goal, one of which was his beauty that tied the game at two. He also assisted on Bostonês first goal, vaulting him into fifth in the defensive scoring race. ",,,

Kyle Turris and Bobby Ryan scored in the shootout as the Senators beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 2-1 Thursday night. They appear to have lost defenseman Marc Methot for perhaps an extended period of time, though, after he took a slash from Sidney Crosby in the first period. Ottawa played the final 45 minutes without Methot, who left the game with a bloodied and mangled finger on his left hand following a two-handed slash from Crosby. Crosby didn't receive a penalty on the play. Methot grabbed Crosby by the jersey after the whistle and had a few words for the Penguins' captain before leaving the ice. ""His finger is destroyed. It's shattered and he's out for weeks,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. Ottawa captain Erik Karlsson said it was an unfortunate play, but a play that happens all the time. This one just went bad. ""(Crosby) puts his stick in as (Methot) is trying to shoot the puck in and unfortunately it hits his finger,"" Karlsson said. ""It turns out worse than most other times, plays like that happen all the time, but I don't think it was intentional or dirty. "" Crosby echoed those sentiments saying he wasn't looking to injure Methot. ""I was just trying to get his stick and I think I caught his finger judging by his reaction and their reaction. I've gotten those before. They don't feel good. "" Mike Hoffman scored in regulation for the Senators and Mike Condonfinished with 34 saves, including two incredible point-blank stops in overtime to keep the game going. ""I was lucky to get it on the blocker there and thankfully it went over the net,"" Condon said of his overtime save on Chris Kunitz. Nick Bonino had the goal in regulation for the Penguins and Matt Murraystopped 29 shots. After being outplayed for much of the first two periods, the Senators were much better in the third and tied the score 1-1 on the power play at 9:43 as Hoffman beat Murray over the shoulder with a wrist shot just 14 seconds after Matt Cullen was penalized for holding. ""I couldn't really see it until late and by that time, he's got such a good shot it was already too late for me to react to it. But I've got to have that short side, so that's probably on me,"" Murray said. ""They play that 1-3-1 in the neutral zone and they just basically sit and wait and poach and wait for a turnover and they're good in transition. It's a tough style to play against and I think we did a really good job of not really feeding into their transition and got pucks behind them when we needed to. All together I thought we did a pretty good job of playing against it. "" After being stopped on a partial break earlier in the period, Bonino opened the scoring at 9:21 of the second on the front half of a double-minor to Senators defenseman Dion Phaneuf. Bonino moved in from the point and took a wrist shot from the top of the faceoff circle that went bar down and in behind Condon. Zack Smith had a chance to tie it seconds later when he was sent in alone, but shot wide, narrowly missing his fifth short-handed goal of the season. The opening period, despite not having any goals, wasn't without its moments, including a huge windmill save by Murray off a shot by Ryan Dzingel seven minutes in. Hoffman had another great opportunity for the Senators but his rocket of a shot late in the period rang off the crossbar. NOTES: Jyrki Jokipakka, Fredrik Claesson, Chris DiDomenico and Mark Stone were scratches for the Senators. ... Cameron Gaunce, Tom Sestito, Jake Guentzel, Carl Hagelin, Ron Hainsey and Evgeni Malkin were the scratches for the Penguins. ... Ottawa G Craig Anderson will have to wait at least until Saturday to play in his 500th career game. .Penguins F Oskar Sundqvist turned 23-years-old Thursday. UP NEXT Penguins: Host the New York Islanders on Friday night. Senators: At Montreal on Saturday night.  ",Ross A,"Sens win shootout, lose Methot against Pens","Just like that, Ottawaês _lost opportunityÓ to overtake the Canadiens in the Atlantic Division is now back in play. With a 2-1 shootout victory over the red-hot Penguins, the Senators now sit one point behind the Habs with a game in hand a re-rematch on Saturday. The first period didnêt feature any scoring, but it wasnêt for lack of trying by the teams. Both Mike Condon and Matt Murray were strong, holding their respective teams in a game that could easily hold playoff seeding implications for either team. The second period saw Nick Bonino score a powerplay goal. It was a beautiful rifle from the high slot, one that had about an inch of space to beat Condon and found it. In a tight-checking, low-chance game, I was worried when the period ended 1-0 for the Pens. I was worried theyêd find a wind to grind the game to a close in the third period. I was wrong though, thankfully. Ottawa would get a powerplay goal of their own in the third. Mike Hoffman would tee up a wrist shot from basically the same point Bonino scored his goal, finding a little whole somewhere and beating Murray. That gave Hoff his 13th PP goal of the year, which is remarkable considering the Sens only have 41 all year. It makes you wonder why he couldnêt even cut powerplay unit 2 when Dave Cameron was behind the bench. That would do it for scoring in regulation though, sending the teams to an OT period that Pittsburgh seemed to get the better run of play in. However, Condon was at his acrobatic best, and the teams headed to a shootout. Bobby Ryan and Kyle Turris would score for Ottawa, while Bonino and Sidney Crosby didnêt, giving Ottawa a hard-fought, well-earned two points. It wasnêt all sunshine and rainbows though, as Marc Methot took a slash from noted cheap-shot artist Sidney Crosby and left the game with a finger injury. It was later announced he will likely be out for weeks. Not ideal for a team that already was suffering from a less-than-ideal defensive crew. Sens Hero: Mike Condon Allowing one goal on 35 shots against a team with as much firepower as the Penguins is impressive. Odds are good heêll only see one more game down the stretch (one remaining back-to-back), but itês great to know the team isnêt stuck when the backup has to play. Honourable Mention: Mike Hoffman That goal was a thing of beauty. Itês too bad itês probably going to be the worst full-season goal total of his career. Honourable Mention: Bobby Ryan He may not have hit the 25-point mark on the season yet, but heês still pretty good in the shootout. He had the run of possession while on the ice tonight, and finished with three shots and five hits, showing he was somewhat dialed in for this game. Overall, I was more than OK with how he played tonight. Sens Killer: Sidney Crosby It was far from his best display on the ice, but he literally put a Sens player out for weeks. Thatês more literal than how we usually use this space. After the groin jab earlier this week, itês starting to look like Crosby has decided he misses the Pens having a Matt Cooke in the lineup.  ",Pensburgh,"Pittsburgh blows 3rd period lead, loses in shootout","Pregame With no Jake Guentzel (concussion) it's Josh Archibald's turn on the yo-yo to sling back from the AHL. Defense and goalie remain the same from last game. 1st period Not too much going on, Alex Burrows acting like a dirtbag but that's not news. Tommy Wingelshits Matt Cullen a little late and Frank Corrado steps up and bear hugs him so at least there's something of standing up for a guy. Penguins get a power play, don't score. Erik Karlsson hits a cross-bar with extreme prejudice soon after. No dice for him. Period ends, shots 10-8 Pittsburgh. Interesting things that have happened are like the score, 0-0. 2nd period The Senators get their first power play when Oskar Sundqvist trips a guy but the best scoring chance comes from Nick Bonino, who is denied by Mike Condon. Pittsburgh gets a double-minor when Scott Wilson is cut with a high-stick. Nicky Bones makes them pay, scoring his 7th goal in the last 9 games to get the Pens on the board. Bar down. 1-0. Nice job by Kunitz too in front of the net to take some sight away. Shots 22-20 overall in favor of the Pens. 3rd period The refs call Matt Cullen on some ticky-tack and then the fake ass 68 Mike Hoffman snipes Murray short-side on a shot it looks like he never saw thanks to Cole taking some vision away. 1-1. Shots 30-29 Pittsburgh as we go to OT. Overtime Pageau gets a shot from in front, Murray strong. Pens put unlimited pressure on but Condon holds. And just like that it's a skills competition. Shootout Kyle Turris goes first, rips one past Murray's glove...Bonino tries for the Pens, no dice. Bobby Ryan next for the Pens, backhand, forehand, goal....Sid goes to keep the game alive, can't. Some Thoughts Big change in the game when Crosby slashed Marc Methot in the hand, he would leave the game. Methot was the dude who hip-checked Crosby into Pascal Dupuis' knee, starting the events that would lead to blood clots that would end Dupuis' career.  Feisty game, Senators look confident and comfortable in coach Guy boucher 's passive defensive systems. Wouldn't think they're going to be an easy out in the playoffs, especially since they didn't have one of their best players in Mark Stone (injury) tonight. Not that Pittsburgh will feel sorry for that with all their injuries. Gotta keep digging and try to find a way and hope the report gets better sooner or later. Ian Cole was really good in the first period, all around the ice. Stealing pucks, bodying guys up. Jumping in the play offensively. He was all over the place looking spry and active. Not usual words to describe him, but worth it. Frankie Corrado with perhaps his most impactful young Penguin moment, dropping gloves (but just hugging it out) with a Senator who dared to hit Cullen. Nice to see him step up for a vet, but taking coincidental minors means 4 on 4 play and extra space for the extra dangerous Erik Karlsson. Big picture, not the greatest idea, but in the moment, can't knock it. Brian Dumoulin has also picked it up and been very solid recently. Stinks to lose and only score a goal, but with this beatup lineup it's tough to expect a ton. Would be great to see guys like Kessel and Hornqvist and Kunitz give a little more. Seems like if Crosby doesn't create something or Bonino doesn't bury something, the Penguins don't have a lot of other scoring opportunities being created at the moment. A bit understandable but still need a little more from non 13 and 87 players right now. Scoreboard watching wasn't great for the Pens either. The Caps and BJ's did the last thing you would want as a Pens fan - they went to OT. Caps won in a shootout there, so they gain 1 point on the night on both Columbus and Pittsburgh. To make matters worse, the Islanders have been sitting in Pittsburgh today, just waiting for the Penguins to arrive. They'll play tomorrow. Gotta gut out another one and try to find a way to keep pace again with the other teams in the division.  "

On Saturday night, he just couldn't help himself. Markov scored two goals and set up another and the Canadiens beat the Ottawa Senators 3-1 to retain first place in the Atlantic Division. ""Tonight I just had opportunities to shoot,"" Markov said. ""I closed my eyes and shot. "" Shea Weber also scored for Montreal, which leads Ottawa by three points, although the Senators have a game in hand. Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored for Ottawa, which had won two straight. Montreal swept three games in an eight-day span from the Senators and is 3-1-1 against its closest rival this season. ""It's a big team win,"" Markov said. ""The last couple of games we didn't play good enough, so we brought our focus back. ""Sometimes those things happen. You win a couple of games and you relax a bit. There's no time to relax now. "" Carey Price stopped 31 shots for Montreal, and Craig Anderson had 21 saves for Ottawa. ""I thought we created quite a bit tonight,"" Senators forward Zach Smith said. ""Price had to make a few sprawling saves. ""As long as we're getting the chances, we can still be positive around here. "" And they are not out of the hunt for the division, either. ""It's fun to have a kind of miniseries with them, but it hurts to come up short,"" Smith said. ""The last two were tough, especially when we're so close in the standings and we're fighting for that first spot. But we've been resilient all year. We're still in a very good place. We're still positive. We're looking forward to a chance to meet them again, whether it's the playoffs or next year. "" The Senators controlled most of the play and outshot Montreal 11-6 in the first period, but the Canadiens emerged with the lead after Weber blasted in his 17th of the season from the left point during a power play at 9:28 after Erik Karlsson was sent off for holding. Montreal upped the pressure in the second, and Markov walked in from the left point and drilled a shot past Anderson at 1:13. karlsson 's pass into the middle of Ottawa's zone was picked off by Markov, and he blasted a shot during a power play at 5:55. It was the 38-year-old Markov's first two-goal game since Jan. 11, 2014. He even celebrated, mimicking a swordsman sheathing his weapon after the goal. ""I was happy,"" he said. ""My boy had a birthday on Monday and I guess now I don't have to go to the store to buy a present for him. I'm going to give him a puck from tonight. "" Mike Hoffman made a clever move at the Montreal blue line and fed Pageau for an offspeed shot that fooled Price at 12:11. It was pageau 's seventh goal in 15 career games against the Canadiens.

UP NEXT Senators: Travel to Philadelphia for a game Tuesday night. Canadiens: Host Dallas on Tuesday night before wrapping a six-game homestand against Florida on Thursday.  ",Beata Elliott,"Sens Lose 3-1 to Canadiens, Fall Behind in Atlantic Division Race","Just as there is nothing more satisfying than beating the Montreal Canadiens, there are few things more demoralizing than losing to them. Maybe itês because of their obnoxious fans, who aggressively insist they donêt care about the Sens when their team loses but mock them relentlessly on Twitter when they win. Maybe itês the knowledge that their catchy goal song will be stuck in all of our heads for at least the next twenty-four hours. Or maybe itês simply because weêve gotten so used to beating up on the Habs every time we play them that the losses hurt especially badly. I know that I had almost forgotten how it felt to lose to Montreal. I had been hoping these three games in eight days would be a great opportunity for the Sens to get their groove back, a little boost of morale in the middle of a small slump. Habs games are usually great for that. But while the Sens played a pretty good game tonight, they didnêt manage to beat their rivals, and thatês really all that matters. The game had a nice pace right from the start, with some good back and forth and a few chances on each side. The first fight of the game came early on between Alex Burrows and Andrew Shaw, but nothing came of the ensuing penalties. The Habs scored the first goal of the game courtesy of Shea _Better Than SubbanÓ Weber, after Erik Karlsson took a questionable hooking penalty against Alexander Radulov. The Sens got a number of chances to tie the game after that, including one really nice shift from Pageauês line, but didnêt manage to get anything past Carey Price. The period ended with Ottawa still trailing 1-0 but ahead in shots. The second is where everything went wrong. Andrei Markov quickly doubled the Habsê lead with his fifth goal of the season, only to score again on the powerplay a few minutes later. Both goals came in the midst of a particularly bad defensive zone sequence by the Sens. Less than halfway through the game, Ottawa had already dug themselves into a hole they wouldnêt be able to get out of. Some hope was restored, though, when Hoffman fed Pageau for the Senatorsês only goal of the game, with probably one of the nicest assists of his career. When Ottawa began the third period with a series of dangerous-looking chances, suddenly the 3-1 lead didnêt look quite so insurmountable. Iêm sure I wasnêt the only person imagining an epic, last-minute comeback (because we all know anything can happen in Sens/Habs games). But alas, it was not to be. Alexandre Burrows got the best scoring chance of the game, but hit the post so spectacularly that Erik Condra would have been proud. Carey Price also benefited from a few early whistles, which are always nice to see in Habs games. Finally, with 1.8 seconds left in the game, Guy Boucher called it quits and walked out early, because heês just that awesome. While the Sens are probably better off second in the Atlantic, it always sucks to lose to a rival, and itês not exactly comforting that theyêre playing so poorly right before the playoffs. Letês hope this is simply a case of lack of motivation and that they pull it together before the postseason, because I absolutely cannot handle another loss to the Leafs. Sens Hero: Mark Stone Man, was it nice to have this guy back in the lineup. He didnêt get any points, but was visible all night, and the effect he has on his teammates is always quite noticeable. Sens Hero: Jean-Gabriel Pageau Itês been awhile since JGP last scored on the Habs, hasnêt it? I was starting to worry about him. He had a pretty solid game all around, and scoring the only goal gets him the nod as a hero. Sens Zero: Alexandre Burrows I was rooting for Burrows, honestly. I like the guy. But I have to admit this was a bad game for him, as his only real contributions were a few dumb penalties. Letês all hope he steps up during the playoffs, because he hasnêt exactly been doing much for the Sens lately.  ",Eyes on the Prize,Three out of three ainêt bad,"The Montreal Canadiens faced off against the Ottawa Senators for the third time in eight days and looked to extend their lead over second place in the Atlantic Division.  Both teams opened the game with early intensity, with Michael McCarron laying a solid hit on Erik Karlsson. The Senators had the better of the puck possession early on as the line of Mike Hoffman, Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Tom Pyatt tried to find an opening on net, but Carey Pricekept the door shut. A high stick from Alexandre Burrows took down Alex Galchenyuk but went unpenalized. Andrew Shaw, quick to action, jumped in to his defence. Shaw and Burrows were both sent to the box for matching fighting majors.  The Canadiens did manage to gain possession, and AlexanderRadulov carried the puck in along the boards, forcing Erik Karlsson to take a holding penalty. On the ensuing man advantage, Montrealês defence took control. Andrei Markov fed Shea Weber a perfect pass, yet Andserson was able to block a classic Weber slapshot. The duo set up the same play soon afterward, and this one gets past Anderson and into the net. The pace quickened as both teams went back and forth exchanging chances and hits. Shaw laid a wallop on Tom Pyatt and then Torrey Mitchell was taken down by Fredrik Claesson. The intensity and speed of the game was maintained through the dying seconds of the period.  The Canadiens continued their dominance in the faceoff circle by opening the second with a win by Shaw. They wasted no time at all and opened with offensive aggression, as Markov carried it down to the dot and shot the puck right through Anderson. Back at even strength, the Senators managed to find the puck again, but good hockey intuition from Paul Byron allowed him to anticipate the puckês movement, and he was able to intercept and clear the puck. Shortly afterward Byron stole the puck again, and with Widemen on his shadow, he carried the puck through to Anderson and tossed it on net. Anderson stopped the shot but Wideman was called for holding as he couldnêt quite contain the speedster. The Canadiens took full advantage of the penalty as Markov scored his second of the night with an aggressive move right into the slot, getting his full weight into a slapshot to make it a three-goal game. The Senators had what was their best opportunity all period, when Price went down blocking a shot. A scramble ensued by the net, yet Carey was able to maintain a view of the puck, and used a well-placed pad and a lot of desperation to protect his net. The Canadiens began the 4-4 looking more like they were on a power play, with good chances by Byron and Markov, the latter hitting the post on what would have been a hat-trick goal. A pass up the boards to Mike Hoffman from Pageau, a bit of fancy stickwork at the blue line, and a return pass to Pageau resulted in the Senatorsê first goal. The goal awakened the Senators, whoês pace and intensity returned to the level it had been early in the first. A smooth defensive move by Galchenyuk on the backcheck denied Pageau the opportunity to score a second goal, perhaps momentarily quieting some of the criticism about his defensive awareness. At the midway point of the period Ottawa returned to the power play, as Erik Karlssonês attempt to tie up McCarronês stick resulted in a solid whack in the head. Even on the man disadvantage, the Canadiens remained offensively dangerous, getting multiple short-handed opportunities. The Senators did battle hard in the latter half, and Burrows fired a well-timed-but-not-well-placed shot off the post. A sliding Price defied Newtonês first law and managed to reach back and snatch the puck. Artturi Lehkonen danced around Cody Ceciand fired his first shot of the night, and followed it up with a second attempt shortly afterward, but was unable to restore the three-goal lead. Claesson laid a hard hit on a puckless Gallagher with just minutes remaining and earned himself two minutes in the box and another two from offsetting roughing minors. The Senators opened the penalty kill with a short-handed chance, but the Canadiens were able to regain puck control, even after Weber vapourized his stick on a shot attempt and had to fetch a new one.  With two minutes remaining the Senators pulled their goalie. They were able to monopolize most of the puck possession in the final minute. Gallagher got a chance for the Canadiens on an open net, but was thwarted by Karlsson. In the final seconds, Alexei Emelin hit Bobby Ryan who was not impressed and retaliated. Both were called for roughing with Emelin getting a supplementary misconduct penalty to boot, probably to keep him from stepping back onto the cie surface for the rest of the night. It was an unnecessary gesture, as with 1.8 seconds remaining in the period, the defeated Senators began returning to the dressing room. The result was a 3-1 win for the Canadiens, and a third win over the Senators in eight games in what was billed as a key battle for the Atlantic Division throne. As a result, the Habs now have a three-point edge over their rival, and just seven more games in the season to have to hang onto it. Thoughts Erik Karlsson is always a pain in the butt when he plays the Habs, but he is a joy to watch and any hostilities I may have for the Senators exclude him completely. Iêll reserve those for Chris Neil. And Jean-Gabriel Pageau. And Mark Stone. And Alexandre Burrows. And.... Andrei Markov dominated this game and may have replaced Lyudmila Pavlichenko as my favorite Russian sniper. The Canadiens power play finished at 50%, which is a welcome improvement. It played a key roll in this win as they scored two of their three goals on the man advantage.  "

Weal scored the only shootout goal after tying the game late in the third period on an embarrassing mistake by the Ottawa Senators, sending the Philadelphia Flyers to a 3-2 victory Tuesday night. Brayden Schenn also scored for the Flyers, a long shot to make the playoffs with six games remaining. Philadelphia began the day six points out of a postseason spot but needing to jump four teams. The Senators, making their second stop on a five-game road trip, are four points behind first-place Montreal in the Atlantic Division and four points in front of Toronto. Kyle Turris had a goal and an assist, and Erik Karlsson also scored for Ottawa. Weal opened the shootout by beating Craig Anderson between his legs. ""We have some video on the bench that shows us what the goalie likes to do,"" Weal said. ""You don't complicate it too much. You just see if the goalie likes to stay out, backs in, does anything crazy. After that, you just have to stick to your move and do it to the best of your ability. "" Weal quickly has gained the confidence of Flyers coach Dave Hakstol since being called up from Lehigh Valley of the AHL on Jan. 25. ""He's been a good two-way player,"" Hakstol said. ""He's scored some big goals for us. He's a reliable player that generates and creates offensively. "" Flyers goalie Steve Mason clinched the win when he stopped Tom Pyatt on Ottawa's final attempt. Turris and Bobby Ryan also failed to beat Mason in the tiebreaker. Weal's goal in regulation was all about hard work - and some help from Anderson. Weal tied it with 5:59 left in the third period after Anderson, who had been stellar to that point, misfired a pass from behind the net right onto the stick of Weal. He sent it into the empty net for his sixth of the season and fifth in the last 11 games. Senators coach Guy Boucher challenged the play, arguing that Philadelphia's Wayne Simmonds interfered with Anderson as he tried to get back to the crease, but officials let the goal stand. ""Things like that happen because we pressure them hard and we took away their options,"" Weal said. Boucher didn't blame Anderson. ""He has bailed us out other games,"" the coach said. ""It's a sad mistake, but it happens. """"For all the saves he's made this year and all of the times he's made us win a game - he gave us a point tonight, too,"" Boucher added. ""We got a point because he played well before that mistake. We're all behind him and we're going to keep getting behind him. He's played terrific for us and he's going to keep playing great. "" Both teams had chances in overtime. Turris hit the right post with a shot early in the extra session, and Philadelphia's Michael Del Zotto and Weal each had a near miss. Turris put Ottawa ahead 2-1 with 7:25 remaining in the third period after excellent work by Cody Ceci to set him up. Ceci deked past fallen Flyers defenders Brandon Manning and Del Zotto to the right of Philadelphia's net before passing back to Turris in the slot. Turris' one-timer got past Mason for his 26th goal of the season. Karlsson opened the scoring on a power-play goal with 3:35 left in the first period, firing a wrist shot over Mason's glove with Mark Stone providing a screen in front. Schenn responded just more than two minutes later with a power-play goal of his own, deflecting Shayne Gostisbehere's slap shot from the point for his 23rd of the season and 16th on the man advantage. The goal snapped Philadelphia's 0-for-16 drought on the power play. In spite of the defeat, Boucher was glad to pick up another point on the road. The Senators are 21-14-1 away from home. ""You could look at it two ways, either we lost a point or we gained one,"" Boucher said. ""And I'd rather look at it like we're on the road and we gained a point again.

Ottawa won in a shootout Nov. 15 at Philadelphia, and the Flyers skated to an overtime win at Ottawa on Dec. 1. ...

Flyers: Host the New York Islanders on Thursday.  ",nkb,Flyers top Sens 3-2 in the Shootout,"The Ottawa Senators have made a habit this year of closing out games once theyêre ahead. Of all the ways that Guy Boucher has improved this team, their ability to hold onto the lead probably stands at the top of the heap. There have been times when holding onto the lead meant holding on for dear life, but by and large the Sens have been successful at getting full value for their leads. It was strange, then, to see Ottawa blow two separate leads and walk away with only a single point after they fell 3-2 to the Philadelphia Flyers in a shootout.  In fact, the whole game felt strange -- like the Sens could never fully establish themselves. Part of that was perhaps the choppy flow of gameplay: the first period in particular was marred by penalties to both sides. Ottawa took the first two penalties of the game, first a hooking penalty on Erik Karlsson and then a tripping penalty to Mark Borowiecki, both of which seemed unnecessary. Only strong saves by Craig Anderson kept the Flyers at bay. Say what you will about Philadelphiaês crumbling season, but they remain menacing with the man advantage. Ottawa was a bit lucky to avoid any damage early on. Soon thereafter, the Sens capitalized on a power play opportunity of their own. Mark Stonedrew a second successive Flyers penalty to put Ottawa up two players and Karlsson quickly found the back of the net: Alas, the Sens gave the Flyers yet another man advantage opportunity before the period was over and Brayden Schenn equalized with a deflection. The first twenty was capped by Radko Gudas and Borowiecki punching each other in the face and then falling awkwardly to the ice. It might have been a metaphor for this game, whoês to say? The second period was something of a sleepy affair that the Flyers controlled for the first half, while the Sens owned the latter part of the frame. Nonetheless, neither team seemed especially likely to break the tie despite a few scattered chances here and there. Perhaps the most interesting development was Ryan Dzingel re-joining the top 6 at the expense of Alexandre Burrows. Burrows has struggled since first bursting onto the scene with the club, so perhaps it was only a matter of time before Dzingel found his way back to Kyle Turrisê left. After two periods, the game remained tied at one. If the Sens had been playing in fits and starts in the first two periods, they never really got started at all in the third. After a brief power play near the start of the frame, Ottawa spent most of the rest of the twenty minutes on their heels in their own end. Anderson again produced several five star saves to keep Philadephia at bay.  It was against the run of play that Turris gave the Sens their second lead of the game, one-timing a beautiful feed from Cody Ceci:  Ceci has, deservedly in this writerês opinion, borne the brunt of a lot of criticism around these parts but itês these types of plays that have Sensê management always holding out for more from the big defender.  At this stage, the script felt familiar enough: Sens play just well enough to hang around, score a late goal and hold on for the two points. Except this time, Anderson undid some of his good work with a brutal giveaway that allowed the Flyers to equalize just ninety seconds later:  From there, both teams seemed content enough to play for overtime and off to extra time we went. Curiously, Karlsson played only one shift in overtime. As of this writing, itês unclear whether the captain was injured or simply passed over.  The Sensê best chance came from a Turris solo effort that rang off the post behind Steve Mason. Otherwise, Philadelphia mostly controlled the play but no one could beat the keepers and a shootout was needed.  In the skills competition Jordan Weal beat Craig Anderson five hole and all three Senators shooters were stopped by Mason. Perhaps controversially, Guy Boucher elected to have Tom Pyatt take the third shot after Turris and Bobby Ryan had already missed. Combined with Karlssonês curious lack of ice time in overtime, these two coaching choices will probably be the subject of more conversation for the next news cycle than the otherwise mostly uneventful game. The Sens inched closer to the play-offs, but with seven games remaining theyêll need to find a better form than they displayed tonight if they want to make some noise. Sens Hero: Kyle Turris Turris had a goal and an assist and rang one off the post in overtime; he was easily the Sensê most dangerous player all night. Itês worth noting that his line looked particularly good after he was reunited with Dzingel Sens Honourable Mention: Craig Anderson Yes, Andy had the brutal give-away that let the Flyers tie it but that only prevents him from reaching hero status. He was forced to make several difficult saves, and without his play Ottawa probably doesnêt even get the single point Sens Killer: Jordan Weal Weal got the late equalizer and then scored the only goal in the shootout. On top of that, Weal was a menace all night long.  ",Broad Street Hockey,"Weal, Ghost power Flyers to shootout win","Tonightês Flyers game, which ended in a 3-2 shootout win over the Ottawa Senators, had a strange sort of dynamic to it. On the one hand, it seemed like this game was largely ... uneventful. I posited in our BSH staff chat room during the second period that I _[felt] like this game has been very fast-moving and also nothing at all has happened,Ó to the general agreement of anyone who was around to hear me say it. Iêm still not totally sure what I meant by it, but it sort of felt like there were times where minutes would go by without much of note happening on either end of the ice, even beyond the teamsê general failures to light the lamp for the most part. Maybe this kind of goes with the territory of where the Flyers are now. Contrary to whatever players and the diehardiest fans may still say they believe, this team is not making the playoffs. They stopped playing important games standings-wise in the middle of March, and while there are meaningful storylines to be following in the seasonês final few weeks (weêll get to that), playing out the string can be a bit tiring. And when games go for minutes on end without much of note happening, it can get tough to watch. But in those moments where things did pick up   particularly in the third, where both teams made a lot happen before scoring late-period goals   there was actually a lot to enjoy, and the guys who were pushing the Flyers to victory tonight are guys who really might just be crucial to this teamês long-term success. Both the game-tying goal and the game-winning shootout goal came off the stick of one Jordan Weal, who was probably the best Flyer on the ice as heês been in a number of games since his recall last February. On the goal, Weal made an incredibly heads-up play to get himself in front of Ottawa goalie Craig Anderson at just the last second, intercept his clearing attempt up-ice, and slam the puck into the open net before Anderson could recover. And then he sniped the only goal scored in the shootout a few minutes later. In a season where not much has gone right and a number of long-term questions have opened up regarding players currently on this roster, itês been nice to have an actual pleasant surprise pop up in the form of Weal over the past few weeks, and while heês possibly riding a too-hot-to-believe streak right now, itêd be great to see him continue his strong play across these final six games. The Flyersê other best player tonight was another guy whoês had a lot of questioning fingers pointed at him this year, but has seen those fingers start to drop lately with his play down the stretch here. Shayne Gostisbehere was always due to rebound   anyone could tell you that at least some of his struggles from the beginning of the season were just rotten luck, and that some points would be coming his way eventually, which they are now. But even if you ignore his shot from the point that Brayden Schenn artfully tipped past Anderson to tie the game up in the first period ... ... Gostisbehere was a man possessed tonight, regularly darting around the offensive zone with ease and setting up chances left and right in ways that wouldêve made you think it was November 2015 up in here. There was a clear difference in the team between when he was on the ice and when he wasnêt, and thatês the Shayne Gostisbehere we came to love last year and that weêve been looking for at times this year. And by giving Ghost a team-high 23:03 in ice time, Dave Hakstol seemed to have recognized it as well. The idea that the first of the Flyersê shiny new toys on defense is not actually broken is surely something that puts the minds of fans (and of the team itself?) at ease a bit. There were other things to like (Michael Del Zotto also continued whatês been a good run of play for him lately, with one exception...), and some to not like (...Michael Del Zotto slide tackled Brandon Manning, taking both of them out of the play, about two seconds before Ottawa would proceed to take the lead in the third period). Some frustrating trends of late were also bucked a bit (the power play was outstanding tonight after a brutal couple of weeks, and Travis Konecnyactually got moved up to the top line in the third period!), while some good things that have been happening lately were somewhat absent (Ivan Provorov had an iffy game, I thought, and Claude Giroux was pretty quiet outside of the power play after some much-improved 5-on-5 play lately). But the good outweighed the bad in this one, both on the scoreboard and in terms of What Really Matters. At this point in the season, canêt ask for much more than that. (Also, the Flyers won another shootout. Theyêre 7-4 in the skills competition this season, which a) is incredible, and also b) itês incredible that thatês incredible.) (Also also, thank you for winning the shootout, the Flyers. Look, Iêm not here to tell anyone what to root for in meaningless games down the stretch. You want to lose games to get better draft position, you do you. You think tanking is amoral and any true fan should want to win every game, power to you. But there is nothing less satisfying than getting one point out of a game that you still lose when you have nothing at all to gain from getting that one point. Either lose in regulation or win the damn game. Thank you for doing one of those things, the Flyers.)  "

Then, Alex Stalock won his first NHL start in more than a year. By the end of the night, the Minnesota Wild - once the Western Conference's top team this season - had their first dominant performance in what's felt like forever. Stalock made 18 saves in his first game with the Wild, Niederreiter scored twice and Minnesota beat the Ottawa Senators 5-1 on Thursday to end a four-game skid. ""The last couple games, we were working hard and we weren't getting those two points at the end of the day,"" said Chris Stewart, who had two assists. ""Tonight was a step in the right direction. "" The Wild remained second in the West. Joel Eriksson Ek, Matt Dumba and Jason Pominville also scored for Minnesota. Searching for a spark with Devan Dubnyk and backup Darcy Kuemperstruggling, Minnesota recalled Stalock on Wednesday for his first start since last February with San Jose. The St. Paul native had spent six months in the minors. Stalock allowed a goal on Ottawa's seventh shot, but Niederreiter tied it less than a minute later. Stalock stopped everything after that, and Niederreiter added another goal in the second to put the Wild ahead for good. Niederreiter hadn't scored since Feb. 27. ""When you don't score as a potentially top goal scorer you get frustrated and it creeps in your game and it's tough on you mentally,"" Niederreiter said. ""And obviously when the first one gets in, you start feeling loose again and then it's just a matter of time to get the next one. "" Craig Anderson had 21 saves for Ottawa. Mike Hoffman scored his 23rd goal of the season for the Senators, who are still trying to lock up a playoff spot but have lost three straight. Ottawa played without captain and leading scorer Erik Karlsson, who was injured blocking a shot against Philadelphia on Tuesday and ended his streak of 324 consecutive games played. The Senators were also without Alexandre Burrows, who missed the game with an upper-body injury. ""I know we got injuries, but the guys that were in the lineup are able to play better than that,"" coach Guy Boucher said. Hoffman put the Senators up 1-0 on a sharp one-timer past Stalock at 16:20 of the first. ""As bad as it is, you don't want to give up a goal, but when you give one up, it's kind of a wake-up call,"" Stalock said. ""From there, I settled in and stopped the shots from the outside, so it was good. "" Niederreiter got his 21st goal 47 seconds later when he poked in a rebound off Stewart's shot. He picked up No. 22 at 7:08 of the second on a backhander. Then, at 17:32, Charlie Coyle made a pretty drop to a streaking Eriksson Ek in front of the net for a two-goal lead. Dumba added a power-play goal at 15:14 of the third, and Pominville scored his 13th of the season with eight minutes left. It was Minnesota's first four-goal win since Jan. 26 against St. Louis. ""I hope it's not the culmination,"" Wild coach Bruce Boudreau said. ""I hope we keep building. It's one game. It'll be a little tougher in Nashville. We'll see how we do there. Then we'll have a little better read on where we are. "" NOTES: Senators C Zack Smith got an upper-body injury in the first period and did not return. Asked if Karlsson or Smith could return this weekend, Boucher said,""I don't know what to tell you, I really don't. "" ... Stalock - who went 20-16-7 in 45 games with Iowa of the AHL - last played in Minnesota in 2015 with San Jose. The Sharks beat the Wild 4-3 in overtime. ... Pominville played in his 900th career game. ... Niederreiter had his fifth two-goal game of the season. UP NEXT: Senators: At Winnipeg on Saturday. Wild: At Nashville on Saturday.  ",Beata Elliott,Sens Get Destroyed 5-1 By Wild," donêt think many Sens fans had high expectations going into tonightês game against Minnesota Wild. Despite the fact that the Wild were on a downward spiral, having lost 9 of their last 10 games, and starting an AHL-callup goalie in his season debut, it seemed like a guaranteed loss for Ottawa. Karlsson and Methot were both out with injury, and it seemed the best we could really hope for was for Anderson to stand on his head as the rest of the team hung him out to dry. The amazing thing about this game is that that last part actually happened. The team did hang Andy out to dry, and he did play a great game. And yet the team was so lifeless, so pathetic, that it didnêt even matter. This little slump the Sens have been on for the past month has gotten more than a little worrying. It would still take an epic slide for them to actually miss the playoffs, but nobody wants their team going into the postseason completely unable to score goals or to summon any amount of energy for a game. I can only hope theyêll get their groove back once the stakes are higher, because this is probably the least confidence Iêve ever had in a playoff-bound team. Or maybe theyêre just getting all their losing out of the way now, just like how theyêre getting all their injuries out of the way so that they can be in top shape for the postseason. Thatês how that stuff works, right? Oh, and did I mention that all the teams the Sens are currently battling for a playoff spot won tonight? It was a great night all around. The first period wasnêt terrible from a Sens perspective: though the Wild carried the bulk of the play, Ottawa got a few good looks at the net, including one particularly good shot from Chris Kelly. They even managed to score the first goal of the game, when Mike Hoffman blasted home his third shot in one shift from the same spot on the ice, in the most typical Mike Hoffmangoal imaginable. Not all was lost. Perhaps the team would manage to get at least a point out of this game. Unfortunately, it didnêt take long at all for the Wild to respond, evening the score. The game was all downhill from there. The Sens began the second period without Zack Smith, who left the game with an upper body injury after the first period. Minnesota continued to skate circles around the team, but Anderson stood tall to keep the Sens (sort of) in it. The only real highlight of the period was a surprisingly impressive Ottawa powerplay, which strangely seemed to have benefited from no longer having Karlsson there for everyone to pass to. I guess the players all realized they had to actually do things themselves without the captain on the point, and the results were impressive. However, the improved powerplay did not result in a goal, and the Sens soon found themselves down 2-1 when Nino Neiderreiter scored his second of the game. Ek Eriksson also scored to put Minnesota up 3-1 going into the final frame. Look, Iêm going to be honest here: nothing noteworthy happened in the third period. It was mind-numbing. Sad. Painful to watch. Probably the best possible demonstration of why Erik Karlsson should win both the Norris and the Hart. His absence was glaring. The Wild continued to dominate and scored two more goals. Why didnêt Guy Boucher leave this game early? Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman It feels weird calling anyone a hero when the team looked so bad, but Hoff was pretty good all game. Sens Zero: Depth To be fair, I donêt think any NHL team would look good without their top defensive pairing, but still.  ",Hockey Wilderness,Wild look like theyêre back on track with 5-1 whooping of the Senators,"The Wild were looking to take another step in the right direction after playing a really good game against the Capitals but getting beaten up by Alex Ovechkin on the power play. Tonight they welcomed the Ottawa Senators to St. Paul who are working towards playoff dreams of their own. The Wild would be short one Zach Parise, but had called Joel Eriksson Ek back over from Sweden and called up Alex Stalock from Iowa to make his first NHL start for the Wild. Both players would factor into the outcome. The Wild continued to play their stingy style of defense which has been getting better as of late, holding the Senators to just 19 shots on goal all game. All they needed now was for the offense to open back up against a good netminder in Craig Anderson for the Senators, who was without his best defensemen in Erik Karlsson who was a late scratch. Unfortunately for Anderson, the Wild seemed to hit their stride against him tonight. At long last, the Wild seem to be trending in the right direction as the playoffs are just around the corner. A 5-1 victory for the Wild looked just like it sounds. The Wild were dominant in nearly all phases of the game this evening. The Senators lone goal was scored barely off one of their power plays as Mike Hoffman got the scoring started in the game just as the man advantage had expired. To rub salt in the wound a little, he scored from Oviês circle nonetheless, well, his opposite circle anyway. That would be the extent of the Senators offense however, Stalock would stop 18 of 19 shots against him and he saw some great defense clearing pucks and bodies out of the slot all night.  Slumps were busted this evening, and not just for the Wildês psyche. Nino Niederrieter would score twice, Eriksson Ek would pocket a goal, Jason Pominville would also find the twine, and Matt Dumba unleashed a rocket of a shot for a power play goal. The big offensive production we saw tonight was certainly a sight for sore eyes, Wild fans have been wondering where their scoring had gone on holiday, but it looks like it might be back with the team having scored 9 goals in their past 2 games.  Neutral zone play for the Wild tonight was in top form as well. It seemed that almost any time the Senators where trying to break into the Wildês defensive zone, the guys on the ice were not giving them any space to do so. When they did manage to get past the blue line, Stalock didnêt see a heap of shots fired his way, and a lot of them came from outside of the high danger areas.  On offense, Erik Haula was moved to the wing with Eriksson Ek centering him and Ryan White on the 4th line. They had a fantastic game. Erikssons Ekês goal came off that line, but they were applying some good pressure all night, Haula was using his speed on the forecheck and Eriksson Ek gained a chance or two on goal because of Haulaês effort. Haula was one of the guys whoês game has been way off of late, but it was great to see him playing his game again. Nino scoring twice in the game was huge for him as well. Heês been ice cold in the goal scoring department lately, having just 1 goal in his past 20 games before tonight. Jason Pominville has always been a streaky goal scorer, so it was nice to see him getting his name in the goal column tonight. All-in-all, 12 players for the Wild had at least a point. Another big night for offensive production out of the Wild. Solid defense, solid offense, great play in the neutral zone. This is the kind of hockey the Wild were playing through December and January and if itês something they can carry into the playoffs they will be a scary team to face. Next up for the Wild, a pair of games over the weekend. Saturday they travel to Nashville to take on the Predators and Sunday they come back home to face the Colorado Avalanche. Just 5 games remain to get tuned up for the playoffs, the season closes Saturday April 8th on the road against the Arizona Coyotes.   "

Still, a late surge has them feeling good about how they're finishing the season. Perreault scored the go-ahead goal 7:46 into the third period, lifting the Jets to their fourth straight win, a 4-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday night. ""We just don't quit,"" Perreault said. ""I wish we would've done it earlier in the season, but it's nice to get those wins now and get that good feeling in the room and knowing that we can do it and build on that. "" With the game tied at 2, Perreault took a pass from Bryan Little and fired a shot past Mike Condon, who had Jets forward Patrik Laine standing in front of him with the screen, to make it 3-2. With Condon pulled for an extra attacker and just over a minute left, Winnipeg's Connor Hellebuyck whipped out his glove to snag Kyle Turris' blast, preserving the lead. Nikolaj Ehlers sealed the victory with an empty-netter with 25 seconds left. Blake Wheeler and Adam Lowry also scored for Winnipeg, which has its first four-game win streak of the season but was eliminated from playoff contention last week. Little had a pair of assists. ""You've got to come to the rink and you've got to play hard, because that's your job, regardless,"" Jets coach Paul Maurice said,""and we've done that. "" Mike Hoffman scored twice for the Senators, who have lost four straight - 0-3-1 - are tied with the Toronto Maple Leafs for second in the Atlantic Division with 91 points. Both teams have five regular-season games remaining. Hellebuyck made 29 saves for the Jets. Condon had 24 stops for the Senators, who were playing the fourth game of a season-high, five-game road trip. The Senators lost another defenseman when Cody Ceci left with a lower-body injury in the second period. He joins injured captain Erik Karlsson(lower body), who missed his second straight game, and fellow blue liner Mark Methot. ""He won't play next game,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said of Ceci. ""We're going to have to recall somebody, for sure. "" Boucher was asked if there was any chance Karlsson could play Monday in Detroit. ""We're going to need some more candles at church to be lit up, for sure,"" Boucher said. Ottawa came in having won all six games the team had played at MTS Centre since the Jets returned to Winnipeg for the 2011-12 season. ""Obviously, the injuries aren't what we need right now,"" Hoffman said,""but we can't really control those things so we're going to have to figure out a way to come around. "" A turnover by the Jets in their own end led to hoffman 's 24th goal of the season at 16:15 of the first, a high shot over Hellebuyck's blocker. Winnipeg tied the game early in the second when a turnover by Ottawa sent the puck to the corner of the net and Wheeler tapped in his 25th goal at 3:29, extending his point streak to five games (three goals, four assists). But just 11 seconds later, Hoffman gave Ottawa a 2-1 lead with his 25th goal. Lowry notched his career-high 15th goal off a rebound at 10:43 - 12 seconds after a tripping penalty on Ottawa expired - to even it at 2. UP NEXT Senators: At Detroit on Monday. Jets: Starts a two-game road trip Tuesday in St. Louis.   ",Ary M,"Sens lose Ceci, fourth straight in 4-2 loss to Jets","The Sens have only had three four-game losing streaks this season. Unfortunately, two of them have come in the last month. The good news? They always won the next game   and itês the back-to-back series against the Detroit Red Wings that will be the focus of Guy Boucher and co.  The Senators werenêt as bad tonight as they were against Minnesota on Thursday, but after entering the third period with the game tied at 2, a point couldêve been had.  The game started with some early physical play, with none other than Mark Borowiecki at the forefront as he took out Mark Scheifele with a hard body check. The pace was tentative for much of the first   a trait that was surely part of the Senators gameplan coming into tonight   with the shots at 3 a piece 10 minutes into the game. After some four-on-four play opened the play up due to hooking penalties on Ehlers (on Pyatt) and Turris (on Lowry), Mike Hoffman showed his neutral zone prowess by forcing a neutral zone turnover on Andrew Copp. Hoff then floated to the right-side, where he took a quick pass from Derick Brassard and slapped it home off-balance for a pretty goal past Connor Hellebuyck. The Senators almost potted another one at the end of the period, with Mark Stone finding a wide open Kyle Turris after forcing another turnover (!), but Turris missed wide. All in all, it was a pretty even period   good news for the injury-plagued Senators.  The second period began with a poor turnover by veteran Chris Kelly, who tried to reverse the puck behind the net to avoid the forecheck of Nik Ehlers but did not place the puck properly. The puck floated out in front of Condon and Blake Wheeler tapped it in on the right side   a silly goal all-around and not one that the Senators could afford to give up given their margin of error.  Thankfully for the Senators, they got the goal right back. Tom Pyatt won a puck battle in the neutral zone and fed the puck to Hoffman coming down the right wall. The skilled winger deked the puck around Bryan Little, and then through it to the net. Luckily, it took a favourable bounce past the recovering Littleês stick and past Hellebuyck to restore the Senatorsê lead 11 seconds later.  From this point on, the Jets started to take over the game. Nik Ehlers had the puck on his string in the offensive zone, maneuvering around Hoffman and Pageau -- two members of the Senators _shutdownÓ trio -- before the latter took a tripping penalty. On the ensuing powerplay, the PK unit of Burrows, Kelly, Phaneuf, and Ceci found themselves out for the entire two minutes -- unable to clear the puck. Mike Condon made a number of great saves, including two beauties on Patrik Laine and Mathieu Perreault, but was unable to freeze the puck. Near the end of the powerplay, BUrrows has a chance to clear the puck but is unable to get it out, and although the PP ends, Adam Lowry finds a puck in front of the net and has the extra energy to outmuscle Phaneuf-Ceci to pot it past Condon to tie the game at two. If that already doesnêt sound bad enough, a replay shows that Cody Ceci hyperextended his leg battling along the boards during the PK, and although he tries to give it a whirl during the TV timeout, he ends up leaving the game -- meaning that three of the teamês top four defenders are out.  Burrows tried to redeem himself by drawing an offensive zone penalty on Josh Morrissey, and had a glorious chance on the ensuing PP, but it just wasnêt his day. The final dagger came early in the third, with the Jets pressing. After winning an offensive zone faceoff, Bryan Little ends up receiving the puck back at the right point. He then saucers the puck to Perreault -- dodging Burrows -- who wires it through a Laine screen and past Condon for the lead with 12 minutes to play.  The Jets took over the third period -- out attempting the Senators 23 - 10 until the final minutes of play. Itês hard to blame fatigue, especially on the forwards part given that the Sens had a day of rest, but it was easy to tell that the Senators D corps were playing way out of their comfort zone, and how much they missed Erik Karlsson. Case in point? They couldnêt transition the puck up the ice to press the Jets, and if it wasnêt for Mike Condon making two fantastic saves on the Jets leading scorer, the game couldêve easily been out of hand.  With the net empty, the Sens did manage to get some pressure on Connor Hellebuyck, including great looks by Kyle Turris and Mike Hoffman, but were unable to put one past him. Hoffman was clearly the maestro in Karlssonês absence, with the team looking for a set play along the right side of the ice. Mark Stone, who actually left a Jets game NOT injured for once (!!!) made a spectacular second effort to save an empty-net goal with a minute remaining, but then gave the puck away with an errant pass through the neutral zone to Ehlers, who sealed the game at 4-2.  Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman The best Sens forward tonight, Hoffman potted his 24th and 25th goals of the season and nearly got the hat-trick in the last minute. He played his tough competition to around even in the shot metrics, too.  Sens Zeroes: Pierre Dorionês acquisitions When you tout the character of the players youêre bringing in, you expect them to step up in games like tonight and not be the causes of defeat. Chris Kelly -- the perpetrator of the first goal -- was on the ice for 1 shot attempt for and 12 against (alongside Tommy Wingels) while Alex Burrows put up a 35% CF%, made a key mistake on the PK, and lost his player on the game-winning goal. He should be nowhere near the top-six, but since his addition, Ryan Dzingel has been playing ~11 minutes a night despite being a more effective player in all aspects. Dzingel only played 6 minutes tonight. With the team _lighting candles at a churchÓ for Erik Karlssonês return on Monday and Cody Ceci confirmed out, someone has to step up before the Sens find themselves playing Washington in the first round.

Svechnikov scored the only goal of the shootout in the seventh round, lifting the Detroit Red Wings to a 5-4 victory over the Ottawa Senators on Monday night. ""Coach (Jeff Blashill) just pointed at me and he said just go and the guys just started telling me `do your thing,""' Svechnikov said. ""I just wanted to score so bad. It was so loud and I was excited, and just did my thing. "" Svechnikov went to his backhand and slid the puck between the pads of Ottawa goalie Craig Anderson. Tomas Tatar had a goal and an assist, and Frans Nielsen, Gustav Nyquist and Dylan Larkin scored in regulation for Detroit, Nick Jensen had two assists and Petr Mrazek stopped 41 shots. Kyle Turris and Fredrik Claesson scored 4:09 apart in the third period to tie the score for the Senators, who earned a point to pull into a tie with Boston for third place in the Atlantic Division. Ottawa is technically ahead at the moment with a game in hand on the Bruins, but if the teams finish tied Boston is assured of having the edge with more regulation and overtime wins. ""At 4-2, our guys are battling and fighting and clawing, and that's our season right there,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said. ""That's us. It's been tough, it's been all kinds of stuff happening to us and we battle back. ""That was a crazy overtime, a crazy shootout. Obviously for fans it's great. We got an important point and we've got to keep moving. "" Erik Karlsson had a goal and an assist, Alexandre Burows also scored and Turris also had two assists for the Senators. Karlsson, who had missed two games with a left foot injury and was thought to be unavailable for the game, surprised his teammates team when he decided to join them in Detroit and play. ""I skated at 10 this morning in Ottawa, and it felt good, so I called (general manager) Pierre (Dorion) and told him I thought I could play,"" said the defenseman and captain who leads the team in scoring with 70 points. ""I didn't tell anyone I was coming, not even my teammates. ""I just jumped on a plane and got here as fast as I could. I don't think anyone knew until they saw my jersey hanging in my locker. "" Boucher, who learned of karlsson 's plans after the morning skate, felt that seeing that No. 65 jersey hanging in karlsson 's stall gave his struggling team, with just one point in their previous four games, a significant confidence boost. ""If he says that he's going to be there, he's going to be there,"" Boucher said. ""We knew he wasn't coming just to be there half. He had a big impact on the game. It lifted our team. It created a lot of enthusiasm. "" The teams complete the home-and-home set Tuesday in Ottawa. The Red Wings ended a three-game losing streak with the win but it didn't come easily as the Senators rallied from three deficits to tie it. After a scoreless opening period, the goals came quickly in the second. Nielsen's pass from behind the Ottawa net hit the skate of Senators defenseman Ben Harper and bounced through anderson 's legs to give Nielsen his 16th of the season at the 40-second mark. The Senators tied it 1:46 as Burrows' seemingly harmless wrist shot bounced off the top of Mrazek's glove and into the net. Detroit regained the lead short-handed at 6:53 as Larkin sent a backhander from the side that found a way in between Anderson and the post. Ottawa tied it on a power play just 56 seconds into the third as Karlsson lifted the puck from the corner to the front of the net and it hit the back of Mrazek's stick and skidded in through his legs. The Red Wings went back ahead on their power play at 5:53 as Tatar lifted the puck over a diving Anderson. Detroit added another power play-goal at the eight-minute mark to take a 4-2 lead as Mike Green's point shot deflected off the blade of Nyquist's stick and fluttered past Anderson. Turris snapping a wrist shot past Mrazek on the stick side at 8:22 to pull Ottawa within one, and claesson 's point shot beat Mrazek on the glove side with 7:29 remaining. NOTES: Senators C Colin White also made his NHL debut. White, who signed a three-year entry-level deal on Sunday, won a gold medal with Team USA at this season's world junior championship. ... Red Wings LW Justin Abdelkader (United States) and both of the team's goaltenders, Jimmy Howard (United States) and Mrazek (Czech Republic), confirmed that they will play in the world championship. Red Wings equipment manager Paul Boyer will serve in that role for Canada at the worlds. UP NEXT Senators: Host to Detroit on Tuesday. Red Wings: At Ottawa on Tuesday.  ",Ross A,"Sens lose 5-4 to shootout, fluky goals","It was a game that featured two 2015 first-round picks in their NHL debuts: Evgeny Svechnikov and Colin White. And in the end they both featured prominently, with Svechnikov scoring the only goal of the shootout (in the 6th round) and White having a chance to also score but coming up short. It was also a game that featured several fluky goals, with the Red Wingsoutscoring the Senators 3-1 by my count on that front. Still, a point is a point, and as many points as the Sens cant get with a depleted defence corps is crucial. Erik Karlsson was a game-time decision, but he ended up playing. The team had to know that a Karlsson at 55% was still the best defenceman on this team. The first period featured no scoring, but with some decent chances at both ends. OK, mostly at the Sensê end. After all, the shot count was 16-8. I was surprised to learn after the period that Svechnikov only played 4:30 in that first period because he seemed in on most of the Wingsê scoring chances. Thankfully for Ottawa, the first ended 0-0. The second period was much better for Ottawa process-wise, but a couple fluky goals had the team in a hole. The first goal came just 40 seconds in. Frans Nielsen threw a puck in front from behind the net that hit Ben Harpurês skate and deflected off Craig Andersonês neck and into the net. Iêm a little ashamed to admit that I felt pretty down after that goal, knowing the Sens arenêt playing at full strength. Thankfully, it only took a minute for Ottawa to tie things up, with Alexandre Burrows wiring home his fifth as a Senator from the high slot. Petr Mrazek missed the puck cleanly, and suddenly it was a tie game. Ottawa would even force a too-many-men penalty, but then the powerplay allowed the second goal of the game. Dylan Larkin tossed a puck on net from a terrible angle that somehow Anderson missed. Itês one he definitely wouldêve wanted back. Whatês sad is that heêd been strong all game, stopping multiple breakaways, but allowed two goals on nothing plays. Ottawa did shape up from that point though. They seemed to adopt my NHL 17 strategy of throw everything on net, and hope for something good. They looked like a dangerous team for the first time in four games. They even managed to draw another penalty as the period wound down, setting up a third that started with a man advantage. The third period saw Ottawa take their first and only fluky goal of the game, and to be fair, it was the worst one of the game. Karlsson threw the puck on net from the corner, and somehow Mrazek played it off the back of his stick and between his own legs into the net. It was an awful goal to allow, but as a Sens fan, no complaints on my end. However, Detroit would seize control of the game thanks to two questionable tripping calls. The first saw Karlsson go off for tripping Riley Sheahan, with EK yelling that Sheahan dove to draw it. The second saw Derick Brassard go off for _trippingÓ Frans Nielsen after Nielsen stepped on his stick. The Wings would score on both. For the first goal, a bizarre scramble in front led to the goal. Anderson dove to poke-check the puck, but it hit Gustav Nyquistês skate and bounced over Andy towards the net. Burrows dove to stop it, but Tomas Tatar got his stick just barely on the puck to direct it into the net (and ensure it wasnêt a kicked-in goal). On the second powerplay, Andy allowed his only real goal of the game. He tipped in a shot from the point, giving Anderson almost no chance on the shot. A two-goal deficit in the third period didnêt look good for Ottawa. Thankfully, just 22 seconds later, Kyle Turris snapped home a great shot from the slot through a Jonathan Ericsson screen to give the Sens hope. And hope cashed in because right after a TV timeout, Fredrik Claessonblasted one home right off a faceoff. I donêt know what the scouting report was on Mrazek, but high glove beat him cleanly twice on the night. That would do it for the period, sending the game to OT. Ottawa had the better chances in OT, with a trio of breakaways for Karlsson, Karlsson again, and then Mike Hoffman in a very short span, but they couldnêt beat Mrazek. That theme would continue in the shootout, ending with Svechnikov finally sealing it. Youêd hope for a better result when you outshoot the opposition 45-33, but at least Ottawa got a single point out of this game. Iêm still scared about the playoffs, but at least this helped. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson This team had offence (and a breakout) for the first time in a week tonight, and it was due 100% to the captainês return. This team is almost nothing without its star player. Mark Stone is a very good hockey player, but he canêt run the team himself. Honourable Mention: Fredrik Claesson He has a bullet of a shot, and he played 21:23 tonight. Nice to play for a coach who trusts you. Shout-out: Ben Harpur He only played 11:30, but he was surprisingly OK in that time, and one fluky goal aside, didnêt have any plays standing out. No wonder heês the AHLês best defenceman. Colin White watch: He didnêt look out of place in his first NHL game. Itês hard to stand out when playing with Chris Kelly and Tommy Wingels, but hey, he seemed fine. Itêll be nice to get the nerves out of the way and hopefully settle into a regular role. Youêd think Iêd have someone to single out negatively in a loss, but I canêt. Ottawa was the better team for 2/3rds of the game and deserved much better than some questionable calls and some truly unlucky goals deciding it.   ",Winging It in Motown,"Evgeny Svechnikov Makes NHL Debut, Wins Game in Shootout","Tonightês game was the first of a home-and-home series against the _most-likely playoff boundÓ Ottawa Senators. Adding a little more intrigue to the matchup, both Evgeny Svechnikov and Colin White made their NHL debuts in this game. The Senators came into this looking to solidify their spot in the postseason whereas the Wings hoped to play spoiler as the last season at The Joe winds down. So howêd things go tonight?  1st Period The Wings came out with some strong play in the initial four or five minutes. Henrik Zetterberghad a nice opportunity from the slot just over a minute in and a shot from the point nearly ricocheted off the end boards and into the Senators net shortly thereafter.  Petr Mrazek did get some work about 6 minutes in when Derrick Brassard rang a puck off the post on a 2-on-1 and then Mike Hoffman almost capitalized on the rebound in front of the net. (For those of you who were forced to watch the Toronto-Buffalo game, this was roughly around when the Leafs had just scored 3 goals in 43 seconds). Soon after the Wings had a few great shots in front of the net. A tic-tac-toe play that was finished off by Tomas Tatar nearly found twine and Mike Green came all the way from the point and into the slot to take a big shot that Anderson just got a piece of and turned away. A Danny DeKeyser turnover at the Red Wings blueline forced Mrazek to come up big again for the Wings, keeping us tied up.  Going into the final minutes of the period, the Senators had four or five odd man rushes that resulted in scoring chances whereas the Wings had more sustained pressure.  The Wings generated a few more shots within 5 minutes to play but we ended this period tied.  I thought Evgeny Svechnikov looked good overall in the first period. His line looked dangerous in the closing few minutes after a bit of a rocky start where he had two giveaways deep in the Senators zone. Svechnikov had lots of jump in his step and definitely got better as the period went on. You canêt really ask for more from a kid making his NHL debut.  2nd Period Right off the opening faceoff Riley Sheahan found himself with the puck all alone in front of Anderson. But unfortunately he sent it high and off the glass. In the ensuing laughter at Sheahanês awful luck, Mickey suggested he try aiming right for the goalieês crest at this point, the puck was cycled below the Senators net, sent out in front and into the net.  At first it seemed like Sheahan had managed to get a piece of the puck before it found its way into the back of the net. However upon further review, Frans Nielsenês centering attempt went off a Senator, off Anderson and into the net. 1-0 Wings. This lead wouldnêt last long as the Senators came right back down the ice and Alexandre Burrows sent a knuckle puck (perhaps a deflection off Tatarês stick) that beat Mrazek high glove. 1-1.  Just a few minutes later Bobby Ryan had a superb scoring chance from the slot when he rifled a one-timer that nearly beat Mrazek. Svechnikov and Larkin combined to make a little bit of magic as Svechnikov sent Larkin in on a breakaway that was thwarted by a last-second backcheck from the Senators defense. Unfortunately, the Wings simultaneously took a penalty for too many men, so itês doubtful any goal would have counted anyways. But the boys made amends for their mistake with a shorthanded goal courtesy of Jensen and Larkin. Jensen showed off his skating prowess, took the puck into the zone and left it for Larkin who just shoveled a backhand shot from below the faceoff dot towards the net. Somehow the puck found its way into the back of the net. 2-1 Wings.  Soon after Nyquist was nearly able to put the Wings up by 2 after some slick passing from Tatar and Zetterberg set him up in front of the Senators net, but a timely stick check put an end to that scoring chance. Minutes later, Nyquist came in on a breakaway but wasnêt able to get the puck past Anderson after showing _shotÓ the whole way.  As was the case in the first period, the Wings controlled the majority of the chances in the second but still did allow Ottawa a few nice opportunities here and there. The Senators really started to show some teeth as we approached the end of the second period but Mrazek continued to play well and get a little lucky every now and then. With time winding down in the period Nyquist was sent off for tripping, and the Senators went to work on the powerplay with 49 seconds to go in the second frame. Apart from an Erik Karlssonshot that caught the glass and a Mark Stone chance through traffic which Mrazek snagged with his glove, the Senators didnêt put much towards the net on this short stretch of a powerplay and we went to the second intermission up a goal. Larkin and Svechnikov had some nice chemistry in this period, so that was pretty exciting to see. As with other young players making their way into the NHL, heês going to have mistakes here and there but he definitely looks like a player who belongs in this league. His pass to spring Larkin on a breakaway was great. 3rd Period The Senators started this one with just over a minute left on their powerplay, courtesy of Nyquist tripping Ryan. And the night of weird goals continued to unfold. Fifty seconds into the period and Erik Karlsson sent a puck towards the Wings crease that somehow found its way underneath Mrazekês pads and into the net. This was pretty similar to the goal Dylan Larkinscored on Anderson earlier in the game. Hockey is weird sometimes. 2-2. The Wings did get a small stroke of luck when Karlsson tripped Sheahan at center ice and the Wings were given their first powerplay of the game. And boy was it an entertaining powerplay at that. Too much happened for me to describe concisely, but the Wings possessed the puck for the entire first minute, nearly scored a few times (Zetterberg hit the post on a wide open net) and finally converted after the puck popped into the air, Nyquist got a stick on it to poke it over Anderson and into the net. The puck went off Andersonês stick, hit Nyquistês skate, hit Andersonês elbow, knocked off Phaneufês stick before finally going into the net. 3-2 Wings. Suffice to say that going on the powerplay with the other teamês best defenseman in the box is pretty desirable. Only seconds later it appeared as if Nielsen was tripped up in the Wingsê zone (he stepped on Brassardês stick) and the Wings were given another powerplay with a chance to put a stranglehold on this game.  And they did exactly that. Sort of. Just over a minute into the man advantage, Green sent a puck towards the net that Nyquist tipped in the slot. 4-2 Wings. But the two goal lead was rather short-lived as Nick Jensen failed to clear the defensive zone on the ensuing Senators possession and Kyle Turris wired a shot into the back of the Red Wings net. 4-3 Wings. This game had a lot of energy going into the final 10 minutes of the third period.  Unfortunately for the Wings, it was the Senators who rose to the occasion in the final minutes of the game. Immediately off a defensive zone faceoff, the Senators sent the puck back to the point, Fredrik Claesson laid into a shot that beat Mrazek high glove and just like that, we had ourselves a hockey game with 7 minutes to go. 4-4. As we entered the last 3 minutes of the period, the Senators had opened up a 37-27 shot on goal advantage after the Wings outplayed the Senators earlier in this game. Ottawa took hold of this game after the Red Wingsê two powerplay goals.  Nothing much happened in the last few minutes, and this one went to 3-on-3 overtime all tied up at 4. Overtime Karlsson opened things up with a contested shot that Mrazek fought off. Zetterberg found Athanasiou at the other end for a big shot that just went wide. Mike Green then walked in on Anderson but Anderson stayed with him the whole way to keep the game going. Mike Hoffmanand Erik Karlsson were then stopped on consecutive breakaways by Mrazek. And in an absolute crazy finish, the Senators nearly scored on multiple chances, the puck got kicked out to Nyquist who went in on a breakaway with under 10 seconds left. Unfortunately for Goose, he couldnêt bury the shot and we went to a shootout in order to decide this one.  I have to say, this was one of the most entertaining 5 minutes of hockey Iêd ever seen, so I highly recommend you find a place where you can watch it. Words cannot do everything that happened justice. No whistles in 5 minutes was absolutely insane to watch.  Shootout Through the first three rounds of the shootout, neither team managed to score. Athanasiou sent one high and off the glass, Nielsen missed on his chance to pull even with Radim Vrbata for most shootout goals of all-time and Gustav Nyquist couldnêt fool Anderson on his chance.  Zetterberg went fourth and just missed a wide open net on a backhand-forehand deke that had Anderson fooled. But Mrazek fought off Pyattês shot at the other end to keep things going. Tatar started the fifth round, came in slow, tried to fool Anderson with a few dekes but was stopped. Mark Stone failed to win it for the Senators at the other end, however, as his shot rang off the post. Larkin opened up the sixth round and looked like he had Anderson beat five-hole but the puck never went into the net. Hoffman came in with another chance for the Senators to win the game but Mrazek got just enough of the puck to keep the game alive. Svechnikov was given the nod to start the seventh round and holy shit he actually scored! Svech was able to sneak the puck under Anderson to give the Wings the lead. Colin White, making his NHL debut for the Senators, had his number called next by the Senators but Mrazek stood tall in net to preserve win. Red Wings win 5-4! Check out the game winner below: It wonêt count as his first NHL goal, but man was that a cool moment. Also very cool: A large crowd of people chanting _Ozzie, Ozzie, Ozzie!Ó behind the FSD booth after the game for some reason. This might not have been the way we all hoped to say goodbye to The Joe, but it sure has been fun nonetheless.   "

Anderson made 24 saves for his fifth shutout of the season and Erik Karlsson and Tom Pyatt scored in the Senators' 2-0 win over the Detroit Red Wings on Tuesday night. The win coupled with Tampa Bay's 4-0 loss to Boston means the Senators need just one point in their final three games to clinch a playoff spot. ""It was a little longer than I expected but it hits home,"" Anderson said of a pregame ceremony where he was recognized for reaching the 500-game milestone on March 25 in Montreal. ""It's definitely emotional, but the guys rallied around it and I rallied around it and we got a great all-around effort. "" The win also snapped a five-game losing streak for Ottawa and was just its third victory in its past 12 games. Jimmy Howard made 22 saves in the loss for the Red Wings, who are playing out the string as they will miss the playoffs for the first time in 25 seasons. ""You've got a lot to play for. You play for the wing-wheel on your chest. That's what we do,"" Red Wings captain Henrik Zetterberg responded when asked what it's like with nothing to play for. He then spoke about the last two games of the season - also the final two games at the Joe Louis Arena. ""We've got two games left and it's going to be an exciting weekend for us first with Montreal on Saturday and then the last game at the Joe. "" It was also an important game for Clarke MacArthur, who made his season debut for the Senators and played his first game since Oct. 14, 2015, because of concussion issues. Earlier this year Ottawa general manager Pierre Dorion said MacArthur had been shut down for the season when MacArthur failed the necessary concussion baseline test in January. Last week while the Senators were on the road he passed another baseline test. MacArthur played just under 10 minutes. ""I was just trying to manage my emotions during the game,"" MacArthur said. ""I felt pretty good. I wasn't sure I was going to get back, and it was great to get back with the guys and obviously a big win. ""Everyone has seen what's been going on the past couple of years and it was great to be back playing. I was very thankful toward the organization to give me the opportunity to play again. Best day I've had in a while. "" The Senators fell 5-4 in a shootout Monday in Detroit in a game they came out flat and were outshot 16-8 in the first before outshooting the Red Wings 45-33 overall. ""We had that feeling that we probably should have won that game and we brought that mindset in tonight and I think we pretty much controlled it,"" Karlsson said. Despite being outshot 11-6 in the first period Tuesday, Ottawa escaped the opening period with a 1-0 lead thanks to its captain. Karlsson carried the puck in from the blue line and just before he reached the goal line at the outer edge of the faceoff circle, he took a shot that found the tiniest of openings between Howard's shoulder and the crossbar at 12:59. It was a different story on the shot clock in the second, but the part that matters most was the same. Ottawa outshot the Red Wings 12-3 in the second, but another sharp-angle goal, this one from Pyatt, was the only marker of the period. On a broken play inside the Detroit zone, Pyatt picked up a loose puck and shot from the bottom of the faceoff circle through the legs of Howard and in at 7:49, giving the Senators a 2-0 lead. NOTES: Marc Methot, Cody Ceci, Bobby Ryan, Zack Smith, Jyrki Jokipakka, Chris Neil, Chris DiDomenico and Colin White were scratches for the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday. ...

UP NEXT: Red Wings: Host Canadiens on Saturday night. Senators: Travel to Boston to face the Bruins on Thursday night.  ",nkb,Sens Top Wings 2-0 in Emotional Game,"Being an Ottawa Senators fan has been a bit of an emotional roller-coaster of late, and tonightês match-up against the Detroit Red Wings was no exception. As you may have heard, Clarke MacArthur made an unexpected return to the line-up in the midst of what could only be described as a mild crisis of confidence for the club. On top of that, Craig Anderson was honoured before puck drop for reaching 500 career games; a thank-you video from his wife Nicole and their two sons clearly had an emotional impact on Andy as he was near tears. Itês worth watching the whole thing: All of this took place before a critical late-season game that would go a long way towards determining the Sensê play-off fate. It would be fair to describe fans as _high-strungÓ when this one got under way.  It was almost fitting, then, that Ottawa came out of the gate flat. In fact, their play in the first period was a lot more reminiscent of a team playing on the second night of a back-to-back against a cellar-dwelling opponent (which is all true) than a team engaged in the high stakes described above. Fortunately, Anderson was the one player who was sharp from the go and he made a couple of critical saves to keep the game scoreless until the Sens could find their legs. And when the Sens most need a hero, you can bet that Erik Karlsson will answer the call. Tonight the captain opened the scoring with a wicked wrist shot from a near impossible angle: On occasion, itês important as Sens fans to pause and appreciated just how good Karlsson really is. Letês all just pause together now for a minute and appreciate. This will be important later. Alright, pause over. The rest of the opening frame was relatively uneventful but slightly in Detroitês favour: shots were 11-6 for the Wings after one. In the second period, the Sens seemed to remember they were the better of the two teams and took the game over completely. The passes through the neutral zone were crisper, there was much less time spent defending Detroit cycling in the defensive end and the reunited Pyatt-Pageau-Hoffman line even scored an insurance goal midway through the stanza. Detroit were rarely able to exit their own zone with speed and managed a meagre three shots. By the end of the second, the out of town scoreboard was also looking good for Ottawa as the Washington Capitals led the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Boston Bruins were comfortably ahead of the Tampa Bay Lightning. At last, for a minute, we could all relax. That roller-coaster description at the top wasnêt for nothing, however, and all it took was Karlsson falling awkwardly into the boards to bring everyoneês heart rate right back up. It didnêt look good at the time, and though he returned to the bench Karlsson never did return to the ice for another shift. Instead the captain acted as a defacto coach and gave pointers to the other defensemen while the Sens ran out the last ten minutes of a game that seemed easily in hand moments earlier.  When it was all said and done, Ottawa walked away with an emotionally-charged 2-0 victory. This was needed to give themselves some breathing room in the hunt for the play-offs but it will feel like an awfully hollow victory if the captain is re-injured.  Just enough time to catch your breath before Thursdayês massive game against the Boston Bruins. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson Every so often itês fashionable to debate whether Mike Condon deserves to be the starter over Anderson. Andy reminded us all, again, why itês just not a debate worth having. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson If Karlssonês hurt again itês really bad news for Ottawa, but the captain was once again fantastic in the time he did play tonight Sens Hero: Clarke MacArthur Itês going to be hard not to cringe every time he takes a hit, and for his sake I really, really, really, hope heês 100% healthy, but damn if Macês return to the Sensê line-up tonight wasnêt some inspirational stuff. This post-game interview may leave with you some FEELINGS.  ",Winging It in Motown,"Red Wings Run Out of Gas, Shut Out in Ottawa","It was the second half of the home and home series against the Ottawa Senators - this time in Ottawa. The Sens are still clinging to a playoff spot and really needed a win after losing 5 straight. First Period The Wings had a chance early on courtesy of the Larkin, Abdelkader and Svechnikov line. They played very tight defense and held Ottawa to two shots on goal for over 10 minutes.  The Wings significantly out-chanced Ottawa and looked to be making things difficult for them. With 6 minutes left in the period, Ottawa won a faceoff in the Wingsê zone and a bad angle shot by Karlsson somehow made it through a crowd and past Howard. Seconds later, Sheahan had a chance to score his first of the year on his 106th(!) shot on goal, but Anderson made the save.  The Wings did a nice job killing off a penalty near the of the period and almost had a chance to tie it up when Nosek sent a cross ice pass to Kronwall right in front of Anderson.  Shots: 11-6 DET Score: 1-0 OTT Second Period The second period got off to a physical start as Ottawa pushed the Wings around and closed the gap between shots on goal. The Sens were not giving the Wings room to do much of anything.  Eight minutes into the period, another bad angle shot got past Howard and made it 2-0 Ottawa. This was a bad goal by Jimmy Howard who likely thought the puck was going to the corner. Halfway through the period, Ottawa had outshot Detroit 11-1 and out-chanced them significantly. They were completely in control and the Wings allowed them to take over and add to their lead.  The Wings had trouble generating shots, mustering only 3 during this period and struggled to get their offense going.  Shots: 18-14 DET Score: 2-0 OTT Third Period Some 4-on-4 hockey to start the third period, followed by a short Ottawa power play that the Wings killed off.  Eight minutes in, Karlsson missed a hit on Helm and fell awkwardly into the boards and on his ankle. He headed straight to the locker room, but returned after a few minutes.  The Wingsê approach this period was pretty simple: dump, chase and try to look interested. Itês apparent that they are quite checked out at this point.  With just over two minutes left, Howard headed to the bench in favour of a sixth player. The Wings created some mad scrambles in front of Anderson but the puck stayed out. Ottawa sent it back towards the empty net, but missed.  With seconds left, Larkin and Helm got into a scuffle with two Ottawa players but couldnêt put a dent in Ottawaês lead. Red Wings get shutout in and probably canêt wait for the season to end. Shots: 25-24 OTT Score: 2-0 - OTT  "

Then they turned their attention to the weekend. ""We're going to keep pushing,"" coach Guy Boucher said on Thursday night after the 2-1 shootout victory over Boston gave them a spot in the postseason and a one-point lead over the Bruins in the Atlantic Division. The Senators have two games left, against the Rangers and Islanders; Boston has one, against the NHL-leading Washington Capitals. Either team can finish as high as second in the division or as low as fourth, which would relegate it to a wild-card berth. So can Toronto. ""That was also the message in the room,"" Boucher said. ""Right now, it's great. But also we want more. "" Kyle Turris scored the only goal in the shootout, Alexandre Burrows scored in regulation, and Craig Anderson stopped 28 shots and three more in the shootout to help the Senators snap the Bruins' six-game winning streak. Anderson stopped Drew Stafford, who scored Boston's only goal, and Ryan Spooner before straddling the goalpost to turn away David Pastrnak's attempt at the end. Tuukka Rask stopped 25 shots for Boston, which went 0-4 against Ottawa this season. The Senators had never swept the Bruins in a season series. ""Our record of 0-4 doesn't really tell the real story, I think,"" Bruins forward David Krejci said. ""So if it happens that we play them (in the playoffs), I feel confident in this team that we can get the job done. "" Ottawa has 96 points to 95 for Boston after entering the night tied. The Senators have the head-to-head tiebreaker but not the most important one: regulation and overtime wins. Stafford gave Boston a 1-0 lead on a power play in the first, but the Senators tied it in the second on Burrows' unassisted goal. At the end of regulation, both teams seemed happy with the guaranteed point - especially the Senators. ""We're just trying to get to overtime. We're playing it like we're up a goal,"" forward Mark Stone said. ""We knew the implications. For us, once that final buzzer went, we wanted both points. We wanted to get as high as we can in the standings. "" The Bruins were without leading scorer Brad Marchand, who was suspended earlier in the day for the last two games of the regular season for spearing Tampa Bay defenseman Jake Dotchin in Boston's 4-0 win on Tuesday. Marchand lifted his stick with force into Dotchin's groin while the two were battling in front of the Lightning net. The Bruins gadfly said it was a""very, very selfish and undisciplined"" move but said he was glad the team had already qualified for the playoffs. NOTES: Ottawa defenseman Erik Karlsson missed the game with an unspecified injury. He recently missed two games with an injured left foot. ... Boston defenseman Torey Krug was out of service after just three shifts after colliding leg-first into the boards. The team did not specify the injury. ... The only remaining teams that have never swept Boston in a season series are Philadelphia and Tampa Bay. UP NEXT Senators: Finish up the season at the New York Rangers on Saturday and the Islanders on Sunday. Bruins: Conclude the regular season at home against the Washington Capitals on Saturday.  ",Trevor Shackles,Senators Headed to the Playoffs After a Season Sweep of the Bruins,"For the biggest game of the year, it was a tough blow having Erik Karlsson sit this one out.  Although fans really wanted a win, Iêm not sure many of us were that confident in getting one. However, the Senators have proven us wrong multiple times throughout the year, and they did that once again tonight. With some key players out and playing a game on the road, you had to expect that the Bruinswould get the first goal, which they did.  Mark Borowiecki got beat and took an ill-advised tripping penalty, which put Boston on the powerplay. Ottawaês penalty kill has dropped all the way to 22nd this season, and it dropped even further after Drew Stafford scored on the man advantage.  After Ben Harpur failed to clear the puck, Stafford was able to wrap the puck around the net, and unsurprisingly, Craig Anderson could not get there in time. It looks like he stumbled getting across, but it seemed like a typical Anderson goal against. Although Anderson could have been better on the goal against, the rest of the lineup played no better in the first period. Anderson actually made a few nice saves that kept the score 1-0 after 20 minutes, as Ottawa could not get anything going on offense besides a few shots from the outside. Thankfully, the second period was better for the Senators. They controlled a bit more of the play, with the shot attempts being 16-14 in the second, plus Alex Burrows was able to tie things up 7:37 into the period. For someone who had been struggling since his first few games as a Senator, it was nice to see him get a really timely goal on a wicked shot. The rest of the period and most of the third period were quite uneventful, as the game was 1-1 heading into the final stretch.  Ottawa had a glorious chance to take the lead with about 12 minutes to go, as Zdeno Charashot the puck over the glass in his own zone. They looked dangerous with plenty of good movement around the zone on the powerplay, but they only ended up with one shot and no goal. Shortly after, Viktor Stalberg took an awkward hit from Adam McQuaid and had to head to the dressing room because of it. Thankfully, he returned later on, but it did not look good at first. The rest of the game did not feature too many chances, and with the game being 1-1 going into overtime, Ottawa clinched a playoff spot regardless of the outcome in extra time.  In overtime, it was of course, stressful as it always is. Chris Wideman had a brilliant chance in the slot to end the game, but he couldnêt finish. Teams traded chances both ways, but there werenêt any breakaways, as they were able to defend quite well considering it was 3 on 3.  Then the shootout came... Most people (including myself) were dreading this again, expecting a loss. However, Kyle Turris scored on Ottawaês first shot, and that was all the help they needed. Anderson shut the door on all three Bruins shooters, and just like that, the Senators hopped back into 2nd place in the division.  That means with a win on Saturday against the Rangers, they will clinch home ice in the first round for the first time since 2007...Get excited! Sens Hero: Alex Burrows I didnêt notice him too much, but he scored a nice goal in regulation, and that propelled them to get the crucial two points.  Sens Hero: Craig Anderson The only goal he allowed was frustrating, but he was lights-out besides that. If heês going to give up one goal every game and itês a stinker, I can obviously deal with that. Ottawa needs him to be at his best in the playoffs. Honourable Mention: Dion Phaneuf He had the third most time on ice tonight, and he looked better than usual with the puck tonight. He didnêt show up on the scoresheet, but I was surprised by his lack of poor plays. It was probably one of the better games Iêve seen from him.  ",Stanley Cup of Chowder,Senators sweep,"This sucked. First Period: The Bruins got off to a hot start as they managed to basically hem the Senators into their own end for a vast majority of the period, finally cashing in on the Power Play as Drew Stafford got himself a very slick wraparound goal from a smart play by Zdeno Chara. 1-0! Drew Stafford is the epitome of a _still got itÓ player. Great move by Chara as well. It wasnêt all great, Torey Krug left the game after his third shift on a weird move that tweaked his leg I guess? Never the less, Boston finished the period with a nice SOG total and the score in their favor. What could go wrong? Second Period, where things went wrong: The Senatorsê brutal 1-3-1 came to roost as the Bruins got caught in a miserable cycle of attempting to get a goal but not pressing the issue as well as they could have. Things went extremely backwards as the Bruins began taking all sorts of dumb penalties and got stuck in a cycle of icings that inevitably allowed Alex _Oh christ itês this asshole againÓ Burrows to tie the game. 1-1 Miserable shift all around from a turnover all the way in the offensive zone. What the hell? The Bruins got caught in this ruthless cycle, definitely showed their physicality on Ottawa! But nothing came of it. And then the period ended and the third began some time later. Third Period: [SCENE MISSING.JPG] ...Okay so stuff happened but it might as well have been nothing. The Bruins were outshot, outchanced, nothing fun or interesting happened, the only thing either side was able to accomplish was make me hate the way the Senators play hockey and their players. Next. Overtime and the Shootout: No Krug, so Liles had to fill in. Neither side was interested in getting the goal in this 3 on 3 setup so onto the shootout where Kyle Turris got the game winner in the first round of the shootout. Bruins lose 2-1 as Drew Stafford, Ryan Spooner, and David Pastrnak couldnêt get past Craig Anderson Game Notes: Your leaders in possession from last nightês game were: Frank Vatrano, Patrice Bergeron, David Backes, Matt Beleskey, and John-Michael Liles. Torey Krug was also there but only played less than 3 minutes total. Losing Torey Krug was arguably a worse problem for Boston than Marchand as the Bruins had real trouble after the first of getting out of their own end, putting them in plenty of chances for Ottawa to ruin the _funÓ of the game. This was especially a real problem for the defensemen. Rask finished his night with a .929 SV%. Minus that one Burrows goal, he was pretty sharp tonight. Anderson in spite of his style was playing pretty darn well too. The Bruins will almost certainly make the playoffs and play the Ottawa Senators and Iêd very much like to not watch that. For a game with almost 50 shots in it, this was an intolerably slow game. I know he scored but why Drew Stafford to start the shootout? Such an odd choice with Spooner, Vatrano, Bergeron right there. The point Iêm trying to make here is that 1-3-1 is awful. Their final game of the season is against Washington on Saturday at TD Garden. Puck drop is at 3pm. Donêt expect too many players that are regulars from Washington.  "

Ottawa clinched second place in the Atlantic Division and home-ice advantage in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs with a 3-1 win over the New York Rangers on Saturday. While the Rangers have had their playoff spot locked up for weeks it wasn't until Thursday that the Senators clinched their ticket to the postseason. With an opportunity to lock down home ice Ottawa came out determined and was clearly the better team. ""I saw (the players) eyes today and they had fire in their eyes today,"" said Boucher. ""I have a lot of respect for them coming out and playing hard. "" The Senators' postseason opponent remains unknown at this point, but they have the luxury of resting players for Sunday's final regular-season game against the New York Islanders. Ottawa has won three straight and is playing with a renewed confidence after having struggled through a stretch of five straight losses. ""This last little stretch really tested everybody here,"" Mark Borowiecki said. ""It just seemed like the perfect storm for a little bit. We weren't playing our best hockey, combined with injuries, combined with other teams coming on strong and bounces not going our way and it seemed like it might get away from us, but I think it kind of speaks of the resiliency in this room, the character in here and the depth. "" The Senators remain without a number of players, including captain Erik Karlsson who missed his second straight game with a lower body injury, but said he would be ready for the start of the playoffs, but feels he will benefit from the rest. ""It's been a while since I rested during the regular season,"" Karlsson said. ""The guys did a great job handling things with all the injuries that we had. Come next week there should be no issues. "" Boucher also said he expected Marc Methot, who hasn't played since March 23 due to a finger injury, to be ready sometime this week. Mike Hoffman, Derick Brassard and Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored for the Senators and Craig Anderson made 18 saves. Mika Zibanejad scored for New York and Henrik Lundqvist stopped 30 shots. The Rangers have lost back-to-back games and will wrap up the season against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Rangers coach Alain Vigneault admitted his team, which was missing a number of players, had a hard time following the Senators speed and skill. ""If I look at it from a positive aspect our goaltender got a lot of work so at the end of the day we've got one more game and then we're trying to get ready for the playoffs. "" Boucher tinkered with his lines and was so pleased with the results that he thought they could stay intact for the playoffs. One combination saw Pageau between Hoffman and Mark Stone, while Turris centered Clarke MacArthur and Ryan Dzingel. Brassard looked great between Alex Burrows and Viktor Stalberg. Pageau, who earned his 100th career point, tipped borowiecki 's point shot into the net to make it 3-0 at 6:19 of the third period. Zibanejad broke anderson 's shutout bid in the final minute of play, scoring on a wraparound goal. The Senators came out flying in the second period and were rewarded with a 2-0 lead as they outshot New York 16-5. Ottawa controlled the momentum throughout the period and took a 2-0 lead as Stalberg dropped a pass back to Brassard, who beat Lundqvist stick side. There was no denying brassard 's relief as he scored his first in 11 games. ""It always feels good to score, especially on Lundqvist,"" Brassard said. ""I gave him a hard time after the first goal and he robbed me in the third. "" The Senators opened the scoring at the three-minute mark as Hoffman beat Lundqvist from the top of the faceoff circle after the Senators had created a number of chances. NOTES: Ottawa RW Chris Neil was a healthy scratch, as were C Colin White, C Chris DiDomenico and D Jyrki Jokipakka. New York's Mika Zibanejad was making his first return to Ottawa since being traded for Derick Brassard in the summer. UP NEXT: Rangers: Host the Penguins on Sunday night. Senators: Travel to Brooklyn to face the Islanders on Sunday night.  ",Colin4000,"Sens Clinch First Round Home Ice, Defeat Rangers 3-1","Only two games left! It was fan appreciation night in the regular seasonês final game at the CTC, and the Ottawa Senators showed their appreciation by coming up big to clinch home ice in round one of the playoffs, by defeating the New York Rangers 3-1. Now the watch is on for their first round opponent, which Ross went through this morning. Both teams were heavily injured entering tonight, with Karlsson, Methot, Ryan and Smith all out with injury for the Sens. Also relevant tonight was that Mika Zibanejad and Matt Puempel both made their returns to Ottawa. It was also an early start at 12:30, so if youêre reading this and were expecting a game tonight, well... at least we won? Maybe it has to do with the fact that the game began so early, but both teams came out of the gate slow. There were only eight total shots in the first period, four apiece, with no scoring. Halfway through, Kyle Turris took the puck away just inside the offensive zone, and had a clear path to the net. At the other end of the ice, however, Tanner Glass decided to drop the gloves with Mark Borowiecki, preventing the scoring chance from occurring. Glass and Boro exchanged punches, and Turris showed his displeasure, although itês unclear whether he realized there was a fight, or if it was a delayed offside call. The Sens took to the power play a bit later, and mid-way through received a brief 5-on-3 after Oscar Lindberg put the puck over glass. The power play looked surprisingly dangerous sans Karlsson, with the best chance being a Hoffman snipe that pinged off the crossbar. The second period is where the Sens decided to take over. Three minutes in, Cody Ceci sent a shot to the net that Henrik Lundqvist would save. Ottawa recovered the puck, and quickly found Mike Hoffman who made no mistake in putting the puck past a sprawling Henrik Lundqvist. Ottawa would extend their lead not too long after. Viktor Stalberg would carry the puck into the offensive zone, and send a pass to a poorly covered Derick Brassard. The former Ranger would score his 14th goal of the year, surpassing the halfway mark for his total last season (27). The Sens and Rags would exchange high-sticking penalties later, but nothing would come of either. The Rangers, like the Sens, were also missing some key offensive players, with Rick Nash, Jesper Fast and Mats Zuccarello all not playing. Quick MacArthur update: heês still looking good. Guy Boucherês beginning to warm up to him, as he played a total 16:25, mostly alongside Kyle Turris. Now with Hoffman, Dzingel, Smith, Stalberg AND MacArthur on the left side, the Sens are far from short in that department. The Senators continued to dominate for the rest of the game, leading in shot attempts 40-26 in the last two periods. Six minutes into the final frame, Mark Borowiecki sent a shot in from the point that was deflected by Jean-Gabriel Pageau and went past Lundqvist. It was Boroês third point of the season, surpassing his 2015-16 total. More importantly, however, is that with a goal and assist on the night, Pageau received his 100th career point! It was smooth sailing almost until the end, until Craig Andersonês shutout was spoiled in the final minute. Mika Zibanejad, who definitely knew what to do against Craig Anderson, scored on a wraparound to make the game 3-1. It wouldnêt matter as Ottawa won the game, clinching second in the Atlantic division for home ice in the first round. Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman Leading the Sens with five shots on goal, Hoffman was as dangerous as ever tonight, especially on the power play. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson Although he didnêt quite get his sixth shutout of the season, Andy made plenty of key stops (18 of 19) including robbing Matt Puempel in the third period. Sens Hero: The Rangersê defence Here was New Yorkês defence corps from tonight (via DailyFaceoff): B. Smith - Girardi Skjei - Klein Clendening - Kampfer  Defence has been a problem for the Rangers all season, and tonight was no exception, as Ottawa was able to capitalize. Missing Ryan McDonagh and Nick Holden only added to their pain. Sens Killer: Henrik Lundqvist Life wasnêt easy tonight for Henrik Lundqvist, as you can see by the heat map below. Although he allowed three goals, he stopped plenty more high danger chances. Sens Killer: Mika Zibanejad Leading NYR in shots on goal and time on ice, of course Z-Bad had to be the goal scorer in his return to Ottawa. Brassard scored as well, so for now, itês even.  ",Blue Shirt Banter,Rangers Defeated By Sens 3-1 In Final Regular Season Road Game,"81 games down, one to go.  The New York Rangers, in their final regular season road game, were defeated 3-1 by the Ottawa Senators at the Canadian Tire Center this afternoon. Much like last game against the Capitals, the Rangers entered this afternoonês contest missing one third of their regular lineup, as they gear up for the playoffs. Derek Stepan and Marc Staal were added to the inactive list today, while Brady Skjei made his return to lineup after missing Wendesdayês games. Given that a good portion of the lineup was shaken up, the Rangers had a hard time handling the Senators, who were still looking to lock up the second seed in the Atlantic Division. These games are also meaningless for the Rangers, who are just looking to escape the regular season unharmed, and prepare for their upcoming series with the Montreal Canadiens. While the Rangers as a whole had a disappointing performance, Henrik Lundqvist certainly showed that heês ready for the post-season. Lundqvist turned away 30 shots throughout the afternoon, and had a relatively strong game considering the lackluster play in front of him. With the Rangers scheduled to close out the season tomorrow night, Lundqvist will get a much needed rest after appearing in six straight contests since returning from injury.  Following an uneventful first period by both teams, the Senators finally broke the scoreless drought early during the second period. Henrik Lundqvist was able to make a series of saves after a scramble in the crease, but Mike Hoffman eventually finished it off with wrist shot from just inside the hash marks. A short time later, ex-Ranger Derick Brassard tallied his 14th of the season to give the Senators a 2-0 edge.  With the Rangers needing at least two goals to get back into the game, everyone at lest expected them to show some life. And while they did have chances, Craig Anderson came up big for the Senators to keep the Rangers in check. About six minutes into the final frame, the Senators took a stronghold on the game following a goal by Jean-Gabriel Pageau.  Mark Borowieckiês point shot wound up being deflected in front by Pageau, and the puck dipped under Lundqvist to make it a 3-0 game. The Rangers continued to come up empty for the rest of the period, until Mika Zibanejad finally broke the shutout bid with under a minute remaining. He was able to fool Anderson with a quick stride around the net, and Zibanejad dunked the puck under Anderson to make it 3-1. Unfortunately, time would run out on the Rangers, as they fell 3-1 in their final regular season road game. The Rangers will have one final game remaining on their schedule, with the Pittsburgh Penguins coming into Madison Square Garden tomorrow night. With the playoffs unofficially expected to start on Wednesday, it will be interesting to see if Alain Vigneault rolls with a complete lineup tomorrow night.  "

Anders Lee and Brock Nelson scored in the second period and the Islanders beat the Ottawa Senators 4-2 on Sunday for their season-high sixth straight win. Andrew Ladd and Jason Chimera also scored and Nelson had an assist for New York, which was eliminated from playoff contention Saturday night. ""It's nice to end on a good note,"" Lee said. ""It's not good enough. We expect to be a playoff team every year and we didn't get it done obviously. I think all the guys in the locker room are going to have a sour taste all summer. "" Interim coach Dough Weight went 24-12-4 after taking over for the fired Jack Capuano on Jan. 17 with the Islanders in last place in the East. They ended up just one point out of a playoff spot, missing the postseason for the second time in five seasons. ""It's an uphill battle when you don't get off to the start you need to,"" Ladd said. ""We did a good job of getting ourselves back into it, but that doesn't give you much solace at this point. "" Thomas Greiss, playing for the first time in six games, stopped 32 shots. Greiss last played on March 30, when he was pulled after giving up three goals on eight shots in first 8:06 of a 6-3 loss at Philadelphia. Bobby Ryan and Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored for the Senators and Mike Condon had 17 saves. Ottawa, which had already clinched second place in the Atlantic Division and home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs, left 10 players back home to rest. ""It was a game where we wanted to see some young guys,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""We pulled out a lot of our guys for rest, precaution and making sure we don't have injuries. "" With Ottawa trailing 3-0, Ryan got the Senators on the scoreboard with 1:06 left in the second, skating in and firing a shot into the top right corner for his 13th. Pageau pulled Ottawa within one 2:34 into the third, beating Greiss with a wrist shot for his 12th. The Senators pressed for the tying goal in the closing minutes but couldn't get anything else past Greiss. ""They stretched everything and pulled us out of what we try to do generally, and we got a lot of fill-in guys that trying to learn the system as well,"" Ryan said. ""We had a chance to get to 100 points, and we missed that. "" Chimera scored an empty-netter for his 20th with 1:08 left to seal the win. The Islanders gathered at center ice after the game and saluted the fans. Lee extended the Islanders' lead to 2-0 at 8:17 of the second as he got the puck on the right side of the net, waited and put it over the left pad of Condon, who was down on the ice, for his 34th - tied for ninth in the NHL. Josh Bailey, who finished with career-bests of 43 assists and 56 points, got his 200th career assist on the play. Nelson added to New York's lead with 6:08 left in the middle period as he skated past a defender, deked Condon and backhanded the puck through the goalie's five-hole. It was Nelson's 20th goal, reaching that mark for the third straight season, and gave him a career-high 44 points. Ladd got the Islanders on the scoreboard 3:23 in with his 23rd of the season, and fourth in last 11 games.

Islanders: Offseason.  ",Colin4000,Depleted Ottawa Senators lose to New York Islanders 4-2,"Well, what more couldêve we expected.  In the final regular season game of 2016-17, with second place in the Atlantic division already clinched, tonightês game was meaningless for the Ottawa Senators in the standings. Many key players stayed in Ottawa to rest, including Karlsson, Stone, Hoffman. The New York Islanderstook advantage of the depleted roster, taking this one by a score of 4-2. The game didnêt start off too well for Ottawa, as the Islanders gained some extended offensive zone pressure, leading to an Andrew Ladd goal three minutes in. An awkward puck bounce off of Chris Wideman left a wide open net for Ladd, who put the puck past Mike Condon for the early goal. Bobby Ryan had a great chance midway through the period, making a hard drive to the net before tumbling down. A penalty was drawn on the play, although nothing came of the power play. Ottawa continued to pile on offensive pressure in the last few minutes, dominating in total shot attempts 32-11 after one. The second period is where the flaws began to show. New York jumped to the 2-0 lead, off a goal from Anders Lee. It was a nice passing play that exposed the inexperience of rookies Ben Harpur and Andreas Englund, leading to Leeês team-leading 34th goal of the season. Heês been on fire recently, with six goals in his last six games. The Sens went down 3-0 soon after, with Brock Nelson racing past Andreas Englund and beating Condon five-hole. Ottawa regained their momentum soon after, piling on 13 shot attempts late in the frame. Bobby Ryan broke the ice for Ottawa, beating Thomas Greiss with a nice wrist shot. The goal broke droughts not only for Ryan, who went the previous twelve games without a point, but for Ryan Dzingel, whoês been held off the scoresheet in his last ten. The Sens went into the locker room with the momentum, although still down 3-1. Of note tonight was the return of Chris Neil to the lineup, who had been out with a hand injury since late February. In what could very well be his last regular season game of his career, he entered tonight looking for career point #250. He earned that point two and a half minutes into the third period, a secondary assist, as Alex Burrows sent a puck to the net that took a bounce and found the stick of Jean-Gabriel Pageau. Pageauês shot went past Greiss, cutting the Islandersê lead in half and giving Ottawa seventeen minutes to complete the comeback.  The game remained pretty uneventful from that point to end, with Condon getting pulled in the final minute only to have Jason Chimera score on the empty net. The Islanders concluded their season on a six game win streak, while the Senators will head into the playoffs having won three of their last four. The Ottawa Senatorsê final regular season record is 44-28-10, for a total of 98 points.  Sens Hero: Bobby Ryan Bobby Ryanês late-season slumps are well known amongst Sens fans. He had one goal in his last 20 games in 2014-15, zero in his last 16 games in 2015-16, and none in his last thirteen entering tonight. With his couple great plays tonight, it was nice to see Bobby have a good game heading into the post-season. Letês hope he can keep this up in the playoffs. Honourable Mention: Chris DiDomenico In only his third NHL game, DiDo led both teams with five shots on goal. Iêm not expecting him to play in the playoffs barring more injuries, although itês insuring knowing we have the options available. Sens Zero: Andreas Englund Not to knock on the young bluelinerês overall game, but tonight seemed weak for Englund, who looked lost on two of the Islandersê goals. Heês debatably been Binghamtonês best defender this season, so letês hope this game wasnêt an accurate representation of who he is. Sens Killer: Brock Nelson Scored the game-winning goal and added another two assists.  ",Lighthouse Hockey,Pad the stats,"The New York Islanders finished out the string with a sleepy season finale and Fan Appreciation Day in Brooklyn. Officially, it goes into the books as a 4-2 win over the Ottawa Senators   and a too-little, too-late six-game win streak to finish out the Islesê season. So with the win the Isles reached the Doug Weight-prescribed 94 points, but it turns out that was never going to be enough to make the playoffs this year in the East. Boston clings to the final wild card seed with 95 points, while in the West both wild card teams finished with 94 points like the Isles. [Game Sum | Event Sum | Natural Stat Trick | HockeyViz] Nikolay Kulemin returned from injury for the (then-still-) must-win in Newark, but with the stupid Penguins having blown the Islandersê chance at a final-day playoff miracle, Kulemin sat out again. That allowed rookie Connor Jones to return to the lineup for his fourth-ever NHL game, while Thomas Hickey continued his spell as winger, as the Bridgeport pair of Adam Pelech and Scott Mayfield stayed together.  (For our future selves who look back on this day and wonder what was going on during the final day of 2016-17: John Tavares, Ryan Strome, Casey Cizikas and Shane Prince were all with Kulemin on the injured list, as was defenseman Travis Hamonic.) Beer League Game It was going to be a sleepy affair, with the playoff-bound and home-ice-secured Senators resting several regulars. (Hopefully thatês okay with the Brooksian columnists of the world? I donêt know. Letês use this space for a random shot at Joshua Ho-Sang.) Indeed, it looked like the players had fun with some casual pick-up play. Andrew Ladd opened scoring three minutes in with an uncontested rebound, though the Isles were outshot 14-7 in the opening frame. In the second period, some more Isles goals to make it feel like a proper Fan Appreciation Day finale. The first was from Anders Lee, who just keeps scoring goals. No one tell him the season ended tonight. Josh Bailey attained his 200th NHL regular season assist on the goal. A whopping 43 of them have come this season. Brock Nelson reached a minor milestone of his own, notching 20 goals for the third straight season on a nifty move cutting to the net finished with a deke: That also gave Nelson a new career-high of 43 points this season, as he also assisted on Leeês goal. (Heêd add a 44th, an assist on the empty net goal that finished scoring.) They say that a _3-0 lead is the most dangerous lead in hockey when itês a season finale and no one gives a damn,Ó and the Isles proved that to be so by giving up the next two goals. Bobby Ryan scored late in the second on an odd-man rush after Dennis Seidenberg broke his stick at the Senators blueline. Then the Sens got the next one, Jean-Gabriel Pageau hyphening a rebound in just 2:34 into the third. Jason Chimera was the final milestone guy for the afternoon, slipping in an empty net goal to reach 20 goals for the second consecutive season. Parting Shots Joshua Ho-Sang, you were a much-needed breath of fresh air. Work on your game this summer like John Tavares (and if you can, find the instinct to shoot a little more) and light the league on fire next season. Kind of cool to see Anders Lee storm his way to 34 goals after the slumping start he had, and to finish the season racking up goals even without John Tavares. Just think, we may never see the Seidenberg-de Haan pairing ever again. I feel like the Islanders shouldêve called up The Other Jones Twin for this game, but I donêt really know much about either of them, to be honest. So, weêre protecting Hickey in the expansion draft as a forward, right?   "

Marchand broke a tie with 2:33 left and the Bruins - held without a shot in the second period - held on to beat the Ottawa Senators 2-1 on Wednesday night in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. Marchand scored off the rebound of Patrice Bergeron's shot. ""I've used the word resiliency a lot and I think it's become a bit of our middle name,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""We've gone through quite a bit in game and with some injuries and we find a way. I think this group has a lot of character and it starts with the leadership. "" Game 2 is Saturday in Ottawa. Frank Vatrano added a goal for Boston in his first NHL playoff game, and Tuukka Rask made 26 saves. Bobby Ryan scored for Ottawa, and Craig Anderson stopped 23 shots. ""Clearly there was two shifts where we just gave it to them,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""The two goals they're just giveaway, after giveaway, after giveaway. "" The Bruins were outshot 12-0 in the second period. Boston is the first team to win a playoff game with no shots on goal in any period since Washingtonon May 7, 1994, against the New York Rangers. ""They didn't give us a whole lot,"" Marchand said. ""They're really good at keeping things to the outside and making it a one-on-none where they get the puck out quick. We're going to have to be much better than we were (Wednesday). We can't expect to win this series playing like that. "" Trailing 1-0 and without a shot since the first period, the Bruins had two quick ones and Vatrano beat Anderson from the high slot on the second to tie it at 4:55 of the third. Boston was outshot 12-0 in the second and was fortunate to trail by just one. Despite having played the least amount of any player in the first period with just 2:20 of ice time, Ryan was creating chances every time he was on the ice and nothing changed in the second. Midway through the period, Ryan took the puck off Adam McQuaid and went to the net where Rask made the initial save, but Ryan pushed his way past Zdeno Chara to the net and scored on his own rebound. The Bruins had a scare when Colin Miller left the game early in the second after being hit by Mark Borowiecki. With an already depleted blue line, the Bruins can hardly afford to lose another defenseman. Miller returned to the game later in the period. Cassidy said he's not ruling him out for Saturday, but there is concern.  ",Ary M,"Sens miss opportunities, lose Game 1","Thatês going to sting.  Sure, the referees putting their whistles away in the third didnêt help, but when you outshoot an injury-ridden Boston team and dominate for a fair share of the first 40 minutes, we expected a win.  Some narratives were right on the money tonight, like the Bergeron line being dominant, the Sens getting into penalty trouble, and a fierce goaltending battle between Craig Anderson and Tuukka Rask. However, some were flipped on its head, like the Sens (!) winning the shot battle with a 54% CF% on the back of their newfound depth.  After announcing that Methot wouldnêt play and that Dzingel wouldnêt draw in, Guy Boucher tried something new in the first period   an aggressive forecheck. The Sens pressed with two forwards for most of the period, leading to a ton of scoring chances for, but also a ton against. The first 10 minutes were even, with MacArthur   Turris   Stone and Burrows   Brassard   Stalberg generating chances for Ottawa while Marchand   Bergeron   Pastrnak answered for the Bês. Speaking of Pastrnak, he couldêve come away from the first period with a hat-trick.  His first chance came with a significant momentum shift due to a Mark Stone (!) tripping penalty at the ~10-minute mark. The dangerous Czech forward slid in from the left faceoff dot a few times on the Sens stagnant PKers, hitting the post with an attempt before the powerplay ended. After, Patrice Bergeron fed Pastrnak on a two-on-one, but Anderson was there to stretch out the left pad to stop him again. After Marchand and Stone (!) took minor penalties a couple seconds apart, Phaneuf and Ceci (who were disastrous tonight   more on that later) ran into each other and Pastrnak came away with the puck. Despite a breakaway from the blueline in, Anderson was there once again.  The Sens had their fair share of chances as well, with Bobby Ryan   who started on the 4th line   getting a pair of shots in tight on Rask and Derick Brassard being a recipient of a 4-on-4 breakaway as well.  The period did end with a decisive edge in play to the Bruins, further encapsulated with Marchand deking Phaneuf out in a 1-on-2 situation before forechecking Pageau into a delay-of-game period in the final minute. Luckily, the Sens came out unscathed, partly due to a Cody Ceci won battle at the goal line to prevent a Ryan Spooner PP goal in the dying seconds. We saw an entirely different Senators team in the second period. Boucher, likely not happy with what he saw defensively in the first, went back to the _frustratingÓ neutral zone system that got the Senators into the playoffs and it paid dividends. The Senators outshot the Bruins 12-0 in the period   the first time in franchise history that they shut a team out of the shot clock in the playoffs.  Momentum swung when Mark Borowiecki took Colin Miller out of the game with an aggressive pinch in the neutral zone that ended up with a knee-on-knee collision and a Borowiecki minor penalty. With Torey Krug and Brandon Carlo already out, the possession-wizard Miller was tasked with a heavier workload but was unable to return.  You really saw the impact on the Bruins, with the team unable to move the puck through the neutral zone and the Sens backchecking hard as a five-player unit to turn the puck over quickly. Erik Karlsson, who still led the Sens with ~19 minutes of 5-on-5 time despite skating gingerly all night, managed to still have an impact, as he flipped the puck from the defensive zone up the left boards. The guy to skate into it? Bobby Ryan, who pressured Adam McQuaid into the turnover, took the puck to the net, and stayed with it for a wonderful second-effort goal that had chants of _Bobby! Bobby!Ó ringing throughout the Canadian Tire Centre. You know what they (especially Sean Bergenheim, Bryan Bickell, and Bruins F Matt Beleskey) say, the playoffs are an opportunity to re-write narratives. With his first goal in areallylongtime, Bobby put the home team up 1-0. Throughout this dominant stretch of the play, the Sens rolled all four lines and it seemed like almost every player had a scoring chance at some point during the period. Tuukka Rask and the Bruins kept them at bay though, and the game entered the third with a 1-0 Sens lead.  After around 25 minutes of game-time without a shot on goal, the Bruins tied it up on their first scoring chance. With Clarke MacArthur and Mark Borowiecki giving the puck up twice without clearing, Riley Nash ends up with the puck near the right face-off circle and finds a wide-open Vatrano, who has some space to skate into the puck and fire it Anderson to knot the game at 1. You could feel the relief on the Bruins bench, as they began to counter the Sens and get the puck into the offensive zone. With the game mostly at a standstill and many fans thinking overtime, Bruce Cassidy managed to take advantage of Guy Boucherês puzzling Hoffman   Pageau   Pyatt; Phaneuf   Ceci matchup against the Bergeron line and leave the game with the last laugh. Get this: there were only four Bruins forwards to finish the night winning the shot battle, and Marchand   Bergeron   Pastrnak were at ~65%. After the initial shot from Bergeron was blocked, Anderson had no chance and Marchand beat Phaneuf to the open puck to give the Bruins a 2-1 lead with only 3 minutes to play. Erik Karlsson, despite being on the ice for over half of the Sens 51 5-on-5 shot attempts for the night (bless his soul), just didnêt have the speed or the time to dice the Bruins up. The Sens managed to get decent zone time and Craig Anderson out for the last minute and a half, but other than a Mark Stone chance near the buzzer, they were unable to get any good looks at the net.  Remember how we were talking about narratives that were flipped on its head tonight? The Senators, despite scoring the first goal and entering the third period with a lead, gave up two to a depleted Bruins squad to lose Game 1.  Ouch.  Sens Hero: Bobby Ryan Unfortunately for Ryan, the teamês losing record with him in the lineup continues, but it definitely wasnêt because of his play. Despite being 11th in forward ice-time at 5-on-5 (just being Tommy Wingels), Ryan showed his skill in scoring the first goal and was relentless all night. Among other things, he took the puck to the net a ton. The Sens really need their depth forwards to win matchups if they plan on taking this series, and since thatês what Ryan is now, heês one of the players that will be counted on to deliver. Good start.  Honourable Mention: Guy Boucher Imagine getting your team into the playoffs, proving the haters wrong, and winning a majority of Game 1, only to have your team collapse? Iêm mixed on Boucher tonight. Some of it isnêt his fault: his biggest weapon   Erik Karlsson   is clearly playing on one leg so he kind of has to play Phaneuf   Ceci against the Bergeron line. However, as fellow writer NKB mentioned during the game, hard-matching doesnêt seem to work. The best line in hockey have played all season together and can see the ice with tremendous vision   therefore, youêll likely need a structured team effort to limit their effectiveness fully. By hard-matching though, the Sens managed to win almost every other matchup tonight (see this visualized below via the wonderful @IneffectiveMath) Regardless if Colin Miller is out for Game 2, the Bês still have a bruised up D corps. The Sens shouldêve taken advantage in Game 1, but will still have a similar opportunity in Game 2. Sens Killers: You already know —but I will mention that Charlie McAvoy, teammate of Sens prospect Colin White at the USA World Juniors and the defenceman who went up against Thomas Chabot, was impressive tonight. He played almost 20 minutes of 5-on-5 action, mainly with Zdeno Chara, and was close to even in the shot count. Although he bobbled the puck a fair bit in the first and second   expected for your first freakinê NHL game   he was also the blueliner who kept the puck in multiple times on the Bruins game-winning goal. His play was impressive, and something we should keep in mind when Boucher and co. try to make up some sort of excuse as to why Thomas Chabot isnêt _readyÓ to play decent NHL minutes next year. If McAvoy can play this well in Game 1 of the playoffs (!!), then Chabot can likely play quality minutes.  ",,,

Phaneuf set up two goals before scoring at 1:59 of overtime and the Ottawa Senators rallied past the Boston Bruins 4-3 on Saturday The Senators tied their Eastern Conference quarterfinal series 1-1 and Game 3 is Monday night in Boston. Phaneuf, a 12-year veteran, scored the winner from the point as Alex Burrows provided a screen. ""It feels great to do it here in front of our fans, it's just incredible,"" Phaneuf said. ""I've played a long time and this is my first overtime winner and it feels great. I tried to get as much on it and luckily it found a way through. "" Clarke MacArthur, Chris Wideman and Derick Brassard also scored for the Senators and Craig Anderson made 26 saves. Drew Stafford, Tim Schaller and Patrice Bergeron scored for the Bruins. Tuukka Rask stopped 25 shots. The Senators had rallied from a 3-1 deficit with a two-goal third period to force overtime. Ottawa scored twice in a span of 2:20 to tie the game. ""It's disappointing. Generally we're pretty good at closing out games,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. Wideman made it 3-2 with a shot from the point and Brassard, off a great pass from Erik Karlsson, tied the game at 7:48 on a one-timer. ""The second period we didn't really come out the way that we wanted and we needed a response and I think that we definitely gave them that in the third,"" Karlsson said. ""That's the way that we're going to have to play if we're going to beat these guys. They're not going to give up. They're a good team even if though they're battling some injuries. ""It was definitely nice that we responded the way that we did. "" The Bruins anticipated a push back from the Senators, but were disappointed at letting the two-goal lead slip away. ""You don't want to put your foot off the gas there, you want to keep at it and not really change anything,"" Stafford said. ""For the most part I don't think we really did, they just capitalized on a point shot, a seeing-eye shot and a little bit of a breakdown and they were able to get it through. They capitalized on their chances. "" A goalie gaffe and bad penalties left the Senators trailing 3-1 after 40 minutes. Viktor Stalberg blocked a shot, but the rebound went right to Stafford, who hammered it past Anderson to open the scoring at 9:47 of the second. The Senators challenged the goal believing the play was offside, but a lengthy review upheld the goal. MacArthur tied it on the power play with his first goal since April 19, 2015. MacArthur, who battled back after suffering a devastating concussion in training camp and wasn't expected to play this season, raised his arms to the sky in celebration as the crowd went wild. ""It was just a great feeling,"" MacArthur said. ""You know everyone wanted me to get one too is what it felt like. ""The whole city's kind of been having to listen to me the last couple of years trying to make comebacks and what-not and to get that ovation was just, wow, probably be the best moment I have in hockey. "" Reaction from the Senators bench was just as good as the crowd's as MacArthur is respected from teammates and coaches alike. ""When he raised his arms I think the whole city did at the same time,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""It was very special, one of the most special moments I've lived as a coach because it's everybody in the rink, the players and the organization celebrating something that must have been very tough to live all year and it comes at a perfect time. "" Boston retook the lead when Anderson misplayed the puck with Dominic Moore bearing down, allowing Schaller to score short-handed over a sprawled Anderson at 12:39. The Bruins took a 3-1 lead late in the period with a power-play goal as Bergeron tipped David Pastrnak's shot. Boston lost yet another defenseman as Adam McQuaid left midway through the first period with an upper-body injury and is day to day. The Senators were also down to five defensemen as Mark Borowiecki left the game after going hard into the boards midway through the period. Borowiecki is listed day to day and will travel with the team to Boston. Ottawa had Marc Methot back in the lineup for the first time since suffering a laceration to his pinky finger on March 23. The Bruins were already down to their ninth defenseman on the depth chart as Joe Morrow was in for an injured Colin Miller. NOTES: After playing Game 1, C Tommy Wingels was out for Game 2 along with veterans C Chris Kelly and RW Chris Neil as well as D Fredrik Claesson. ... The Bruins remain without C David Krejci. Miller joined the list of injured defensemen with Torey Krug and Brandon Carlo.  ",Beata Elliott,Sens Defeat Bruins 4-3 in Epic Comeback,"Are you alive, Sens fans? Are you okay? We can all take a deep breath now. Unclench our butts. Wipe the tears off our faces (donêt try to hide it: I know everyone cried once when MacArthur scored and then again after that awful second period). Turn off caps lock on our keyboards. Stop drunk tweeting all the Bruins fans we follow on Twitter. Breathe. Itês over. We won. It was only game two of the playoffs, but damn was that one amazing hockey game. It was an emotional rollercoaster, demonstrating the very best and worst of playoff hockey, but we made it through. With at least three more games to look forward to this postseason, thereês hope. And you know what? Even if the Sens donêt end up winning the series, the gifs that came out of it will stay with us forever. Considering the excitement of the last few minutes of that game, I donêt think there are many of us who want to relive the first 40, so Iêll make this quick. The beginning of this game sucked. After a very solid showing in game 1, the team looked particularly lifeless. The play was slow, sleepy and downright discouraging. Despite a few flashes of brilliance, the Sens mostly looked afraid of the Bruins. The first period ended without any goals and with the shots almost even, but it was clear that Ottawa would need to step up if they wanted to tie the series.  They also lost one of their defensemen, when Mark Borowiecki left the game with a particularly painful-looking lower body injury. Considering it was Boro, and in the playoffs, the fact that he actually stayed out of the game suggests that he probably needs it amputated or something. Nothing else would keep him out. Iêm not the biggest Borowiecki fan, but I do hope he gets better soon. That looked bad. Things got even worse in the second period, however. It felt like every time Phaneuf and Ceci stepped on the ice, the Sens got hemmed in their own zone as the Bruins fired shot after shot at poor Craig Anderson. Sure enough, this quickly turned into a goal for Boston, one of those goals after which your first thought is _yeah, I saw that coming a mile away.Ó The play initially looked offside, and it seemed like Guy Boucher would win the Coachês Challenge, but alas. The refs were unable to prove conclusively that the Bruins were offside, and the goal stood.  (If Iêm being completely honest here, itês a dumb rule and it really sucks that itês being implemented in the playoffs, as nice as it would have been to have that goal overturned.) And then the most wonderful thing happened. Bobby Ryan found Clarke MacArthur in the slot, and the left winger fired home his first goal in two years to even the score. I donêt care that the Bruins scored right after that. I donêt care that the Sens scored three more goals in that game, including one in overtime. That right there was one of the best goals in Senators history and a moment that I donêt think any of us are going to forget any time soon. Welcome back, Clarkey. We missed you so, so much. Things went downhill after that. Boston capitalized on a horrific gaffe from Craig Anderson and Derick Brassard, and soon scored yet again to take a 3-1 lead heading into the third. There was little hope as the Sens still looked completely defeated. The power play wasnêt great. The penalty kill was downright awful. Nothing was working. But this team has a funny way of turning things around right when youêve finally lost faith in them.  The tide turned when Chris Widemanês shot found its way past Tuukka Rask for the defencemanês first career playoff goal. Down by only one and with plenty of time left to tie things, Ottawa definitely seemed to gain a lot of confidence. Only two minutes later, Mark Stone entered the Boston zone and sent the puck to Mike Hoffman, who gave it to Karlssonwho then walked around the entire Boston team before feeding Brassard in the most beautiful offensive zone sequence I have seen in a long time. With plenty of time left in the game, the score was even at three. And just like that, the Sens were back in shape. Neither team managed to score during regulation, despite a few close calls on both sides, and the game went into overtime.  For the record, playoff overtime is wonderful when you have no emotional investment in the game. But when your team is playing? Itês the absolute worst. The Senators were all over the Bruins from the very start, opening the extra frame on the man advantage. Two early posts just about gave us all a heart attack, but it only took two minutes for Dion Phaneuf to complete the comeback with a blast from the point. Thanks, Toronto. Hope youêre enjoying Jared Cowen. Look. I know the Sens didnêt play their best hockey in the first two periods. I know we all have plenty of reason to be concerned about the state of the team. I also know that the series is headed to Boston and itês going to be very tough for the Sens to win on the road. But personally, this win restored my confidence in this team far more than a 1-0 regulation win would have.  Yes, this team is better than the 2015 Senators. But this yearês team has been missing the magic of the Hamburglar run. There havenêt really been any epic comebacks, or even particularly exciting games. They donêt look like they care that much. These last few weeks especially have been extremely worrying. There has been no intensity, no heart, no passion. Even in game 1, when Ottawa pulled their goalie in the last minute, I didnêt believe they would score. This team isnêt like that. They donêt do heart-stopping, last-minute comebacks. But this game proved that they havenêt lost that magic. They still care. They can still complete epic comebacks. They donêt roll over and die every time they start losing. Theyêre still the same ridiculously passionate, lovable team they were in 2015, only better. If they can keep that up, they might actually stand a chance in this series. So welcome back, Pesky Sens. We missed you. Sens Hero: Clarke MacArthur God, I love that guy. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson Iêm still worried about the Captainês health, but he had a pretty great game tonight. That assist on the Brassard goal was particularly beautiful. Honourable Mention: Dion Phaneuf Iêm hesitant to give him the nod because his pairing with Ceci is still a flaming pile of garbage, but that overtime goal was pretty amazing.  ",Stanley Cup of Chowder,Late period woes bring Boston to a tied series.,"Ugh. First Period: Everything in the first period was more or less a _Feeling outÓ period for both teams, both sides mostly just taking low quality shots on each other, with Rask seeing some of the more interesting chances and steering them away. The only really important thing to note from this period was that Adam McQuaid left the game around 6 minutes into the period and did not return ..giving Charlie McAvoy an opportunity to be interesting and fun for all to watch, as his already interesting deployment only doubled after that. Second Period: The good times only got rolling more in the second as Boston drew first blood with Drew Stafford, who had been having a pretty rough couple of shifts beforehand, was able to open the scoring with a wicked shot capping off an absolutely ruthless Bruins shift in which Ryan Spooner drew three Senators straight to him as one of many highlights of Senators playing brutal defense. 1-0 Bruins! Unfortunately, Boston would get put on the PK not soon after, and Clarke MacArthur, who hasnêt scored since 2015, would pot it home off of a passing play that found Rask dead to rights and Kevan Miller extremely out of position. 1-1 tie. Not long after, Matt Beleskey and a number of players got into a big olê scrum and ended up with another penalty to kill once the Refs pulled everyone apart. Unfortunately for the Sens, Craig Anderson had some kind of brain fart and allowed Dominic Moore to catch him and Erik Karlsson off guard, and Moore gave Tim Schaller a lay up pass and a practically open net to score into. 2-1 Bruins!  Things only got better as Boston pressed the advantage, and yet another strong shift on the Power Play got David Pastrnak another patented David Pastrnak shot, and who but Patrice Bergeron was able to completely redirect the puck right into the net for him. 3-1 Bruins ith all this, Boston looked to be riding high into the third with all the momentum and an Ottawa team that was just defeated and broken looking. What could go wrong? Third Period, where everything went wrong: I just- How did- Yeah. Boston coughed this up. Badly. It started simple enough as the Sens didnêt seem all that interested in putting anything on Rask that could challenge him, until McAvoy and Zack Smith got in front of Rask and well... 3-2 Bruins. It didnêt get much better from there. Eric Karlsson and the Sens roared to life not too soon after, Karlsson had a tremendous individual shift that had Derrick Brassard wide open after drawing everyone to him, and the game was tied. The rest of the period was Boston not necessarily trying to win, but trying their best not to lose in regulation, and at the worst possible time, Zdeno Chara took a delay of game penalty in the final few seconds of regular play, and the Bruins would have to kill a penalty in Overtime. Overtime: Boston tries to kill a penalty, allows two shots to ring off the iron, kills the penalty, has a vulnerable minute, and Dion Phaneuf capitalizes and ties the series with a game winner from the point. ame Notes: Boston let this one get away from them. Pure and simple. A miserable, passive, prevent-defense-ass third period put Boston into the hole they dug for themselves and why they lost the game. Every single Boston Bruin and coach on the ice and behind the bench should take responsibility for just assuming they could stop the Sens by scoring two extra goals, including one they were practically gifted. McAvoy played a lot of minutes, played very well, but also showed plenty of rookie mistakes that can and should be ironed out by Monday night. The Moore line, for all the negative and positive about their need, came to play for the first two period, playing very well for the first 40. Your possession leaders for tonight were: Tim Schaller, Matt Beleskey, Sean Kuraly, Frank Vatrano, and Charlie McAvoy. Losing McQuaid probably means another Call-up is in the works. Likely OêGara? Who knows. The island of misfit toys is continuing to be the third line and it didnêt get any better with time. David Krejci please come back. McAvoy can do a lot, but itês clear that making him play those kinds of minutes without his defense partners being appropriately rested isnêt good for Boston. Many had to do double duties and having McQuaid for at least the first 40 mightêve been much better for things. Come back to Boston, get the series lead, figure it out from there.  "

In Game 3, they had to stave off a furious charge by the Bruins to regain the series lead. Bobby Ryan scored on a tip-in on a power play 5:43 into overtime, and Ottawa recovered after giving up a three-goal lead to beat Boston 4-3 Monday night and take a 2-1 edge in the first-round series. Just over a minute after Bruins center Riley Nash received a two-minute penalty for roughing Ryan, Ryan got free in the zone, tapping the puck in on assists by Kyle Turris and Erik Karlsson. Mike Hoffman added two goals for Ottawa, with Derick Brassard scoring the other. Craig Anderson finished with 17 saves. ""I always say that you make your money during the season, but you make your reputation in the playoffs, and right now he's showing everybody that he's a gamer,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said of Ryan. It was the second straight overtime game of the series, and second consecutive win for the Senators following their 4-3 victory in Game 2. Game 4 is Wednesday night in Boston. This time, the Bruins rallied from a 3-0 deficit with three goals in the second period, tying the game on a power-play goal by David Pastrnak. Noel Acciari and David Backes also scored for the Bruins. Tuukka Raskstopped 28 shots. ""We were allowed to play in the second and third (periods), we were a better team,"" Pastrnak said. ""We had many opportunities to end it in the third. "" Bruins fans rained sustained boos on the referees after ryan 's goal and threw items on the TD Garden ice in protest of Nash's penalty, which give the Senators the man advantage. Boston interim coach Bruce Cassidy said the penalty zapped the energy from his team's surge to tie it in regulation. ""Yeah, I agree with you 100 percent - demoralizing,"" he said. Ottawa seemed to be cruising in the second period following hoffman 's second goal of the night off a power play to make it 3-0. But then Boston finally got going on the offensive end. First, Acciari, who returned from injury, scored with a tip-in off a miss by John-Michael Liles. That was followed 42 seconds later by Backes' slap shot after he broke through the defense to swipe the puck and open the ice. Then, the Bruins finally cashed in on Pastrnak's goal, with Dion Phaneuf in the penalty box for slashing. It nearly nullified what was a dominant start by the Senators, who kept the action on their side of the red line for most of the first period. The Bruins played through a rash of injuries in the first two games and were missing defensemen Adam McQuaid, Torey Krug, Brandon Carlo and Colin Miller on Monday. Acciari and center David Krejci both returned, but Boston struggled early to find much offensive traction. Hoffman and Brassard scored just 25 seconds apart in the first period and exploited a depleted Boston defense to give Ottawa a 2-0 lead. The Bruins made up for their sloppy start and came out more aggressive on the offensive end in the second period, scoring three goals on just seven shots - including the two in 42 seconds - to get back into the game. The Senators outshot the Bruins 10-3 in the first, taking advantage of several defensive breakdowns on their side of the ice. Ottawa's first goal of the night came after Karlsson flipped a pass behind Boston's defense to spring Hoffman on a breakaway. Hoffman controlled the puck and easily tapped it by Rask into the right corner of the net. Then Brassard got on the board, slipping a slap shot by Rask for his second goal in two games. Backes had the best opportunity to score for the Bruins in first period, but his attempt to fire a glove-side shot by Anderson was wide right, striking the post. It was the first game of the series that the Bruins had trailed after the opening 20 minutes. ""Momentums are crazy,"" Anderson said. ""Win your little battles and it goes a long way in the war. "" NOTES: Ottawa was 2 for 4 on power plays. ... Acciari and Tommy Crossboth played in their first NHL playoff games, bringing the total to 11 Bruins that have made their postseason debuts in the series.  ",nkb,Sens top B's 4-3 in O.T,"Itês often said that the best players come to play in the biggest games. The true stars of the game perform in the biggest moments. Erik Karlsson is more than just one of the best players, he is a transcendent talent. For the last two games now, heês reminded us of this fact in so many different and amazing ways that it almost beggars belief. The Boston Bruins are a very good hockey team, but the Ottawa Senators have Erik Karlsson. Tonight, that was enough. Barely. Karlsson gave us a first glimpse of what was to come less than five minutes into the game when he made a brilliant play to keep the puck in at the point and find Ryan Dzingel wide open at the side of the net. Dzingel could have perhaps done more to get the puck up, but an incredible sprawling save was still required from Tuukka Rask to keep the game scoreless. Mere minutes later, however, we were treated to one of the most beautiful goals in Ottawa Senators Play-off history: I could go on for pages at a time describing this goal, it was that good. Needless to say the pass from Karlsson is incredible but the clean reception and finish by Mike Hoffman was no less impressive. If Erik Karlsson is a transcendent player, Hoffman is at the very least a very good one and very good players also rise to the occasion. Hoffman was fantastic in this game and easily the Sensê second best player. Less than a minute later, Karlsson made another fantastic play to start a sequence that ended with Derick Brassard wristing a shot past Rask from in close. The Sens were firing on all cylinders and truthfully things could not have gone much better in the first period. David Backes put one off the crossbar off a rush, but that was really the only chance the Bruins mustered. Shots were 11-3 for the good guys through one. The second period continued much as the first had ended and Hoffman again bulged the twine, this time on the power play. Ottawaês power play has often been accused of being too predictable but the puck movement preceding this Hoffman rocket was pristine: It was 3-0, and life was good. Boston seemed to have no answer for the Sens strong puck movement in the offensive end, Karlsson had achieved a higher consciousness, and the #System was in full effect. What could go wrong? Well, lots as it turns out. Three Bruins goals in rapid succession: If you've subjected yourself to Ottawa Senators fandom for long enough, you know these things are never easy. As the teams headed to the third deadlocked at three, you could have cut the tension in the air. The third was extremely tame by the standards of the forty minutes that had come before. Hoffman rang one off the bar on a one-timer from the high slot and Craig Anderson somewhat redeemed himself with a spectacular save on David Krejci with just less than ten minutes to go. Anderson wasn't quite himself tonight, but he was good enough and that save would prove crucial in giving the Sens a chance to win. At the beginning of this article, I said that the best players make the biggest plays at the most crucial moments. As if Karlsson hadn't done enough to this point, he jump-started a Bobby Ryan overtime winner as a Sens power play was drawing to its end. The give-and-go from Ryan to Kyle Turris was great, but none of it happens without Karlsson first losing the Bruins' fore-checker then hitting Ryan in stride at the far blue line. Savor this, friends: Special players make special plays. Thank God for Erik Karlsson, because this was beginning to look a lot like the one that got away. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson The captain was easily the best player on the ice for either team. Boston, a team with Patrice Bergeron on it, has no answer for Karlsson. It's been something to behold Sens Hero: Mike Hoffman If not for Erik Karlsson, this would have been hoffman 's play-off coming out party. Two goals and terrific offensive play throughout will more than do. Sens Hero: Bobby Ryan If the B's had come all the way back to win that game after ryan 's gaffe on the second goal, I'm not sure we would have ever heard the end of it. Instead, we're celebrating the Sens' leading scorer in the play-offs.   ",,,

Not that they've had much trouble with them in Boston. Bobby Ryan scored early in the third period, Craig Anderson stopped 22 shots for his fourth career postseason shutout and the Senators beat Boston 1-0 on Wednesday night for a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series. It was Ottawa's fifth straight win in Boston dating to 2015 and seventh victory in eight tries - home or away - this season. Game 5 is Friday night in the Canadian capital. ""We worked so hard to get home ice for the first round of the playoffs,"" Senators forward Zach Smith said. ""It's nice to get some wins here and go back and potentially have the chance to close it off at home. "" Tuukka Rask made 26 saves for Boston, which had a goal disallowed in the second when Ottawa coach Guy Boucher challenged and the replay showed Noel Acciari was offsides. The Bruins need a victory on Friday to force the series back to Boston. ""We'll show up, show some character,"" Rask said. ""We've been on the other side. Us, as veterans, have to make sure the young guys don't hang their heads. "" Every game so far in this best-of-seven series has been settled by a one-goal margin, including back-to-back overtimes in Games 2 and 3. ""You're not going to win 7-6 every night,"" Bruins forward Brad Marchandsaid. ""You've got to be able to play any style, so that's the way it is. "" The game remained scoreless until 5:49 into the third, when Erik karlsson 's shot deflected off Rask to his stick side. Ryan pulled it from his backhand to his forehand and swiped at it as Zdeno Chara dove behind Rask into the crease to try to knock the puck away from the goal line. ""There's always a game or two in the series where it's like chess. It's nice and slow and strategic moves,"" Anderson said. ""We played our system to a T. We weathered the storm early and just stuck with it and made good on our chance in the third. "" The 6-foot-9 Chara was able to reach out and prevent the first attempt from going in, but Ryan pushed it over the line with his second. The Bruins pulled Rask with almost 2 minutes left and managed a couple of scoring chances - both from Marchand - but Anderson turned them away. ""Very good goaltending on both sides,"" Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""Their guy was one goal better than us. "" NOTES: Bruins D Colin Miller returned after missing Games 2 and 3 with an unspecified injury. ... Ottawa D Mark Borowiecki missed his second straight game. ""Boro is getting closer every day,"" Boucher said. ... Ottawa F Tom Pyatt left after a hit from Kevan Miller early in the first. ... Bruins C Patrice Bergeron, a three-time Selke Trophy winner, was named a finalist for the award for the sixth time Wednesday.  ",Ross A,Anderson shutout leads Sens to 3-1 series lead,"Everyone had been saying before the game that the Ottawa Senators had staked a 2-1 series lead despite Craig Anderson. Not that Andy had been bad per se, but an .898 save percentage wasnêt up to his season standard. Safe to say he won this one for Ottawa. The first period saw the Senators start poorly. It wasnêt so much that they were flat, but that they seemed to think they were the worse team. They were content to let the Bruins lead the attack, and would use their speed to counter-attack when chances arose. That led to Brad Marchand getting a few good chances early, including a breakaway, but Craig Andersonstanding tall. Tom Pyatt also got hit early and looked very much in pain heading to the bench. He wouldnêt return after playing just one shift in the period. Later on, Erik Karlsson got one shot off the rush, and then Mike Hoffman used his speed to draw the first penalty of the game, forcing Kevan Miller into a holding penalty. On the powerplay, Alexandre Burrows seemed to get away with a trip on Zdeno Chara (likely because Charaês so tall, it doesnêt look like tripping), but then the Bruins got away with a boarding call on Viktor Stablerg so we could call it even. As the period wound down, Marchand somehow found himself on another breakaway, but Andy decided he was having none of it: Thatês some vintage Dominik Hasek there. Andy made a couple other great saves late in the period to keep the score 0-0. In the end, the Sens outshot the Bruins 14-12 in the period, but I canêt for the life of me figure out how that happened. For the fourth time in four games, the Sens didnêt allow a goal in the first. (And for the third time, neither team scored in the first.) The coaches must have been unimpressed with that high-flying first period, because the shot count in the second was 5-5. It really wasnêt a very exciting period. Probably the most memorable part came when Noel Acciari thought he had his second NHL playoff goal, only for the Sens to challenge for offside and succeed. The third period was also played fairly tight, with shots ending up 8-5. Ottawa opened the scoring five minutes in, with Bobby Ryan scoring his third goal of the playoffs. He now have five points in four playoff games after 25 points in 62 regular season games. The goal came thanks to Erik Karlsson (who else) setting him up with an absolute beauty of a slap pass. It just further cemented Karlsson as the best player in this yearês playoffs thus far. Boston didnêt seem to press too hard for an equalizer, definitely not as much as youêd expect of a team about to go down 3-1 in a playoff series, but they did get a great chance to tie it up with just over a minute left. Brad Marchand (who else) got the puck beside the net, but a great sprawl by Andy kept the puck out. And that would do it for the game. The Sens would win a 1-0 game, and take a commanding 3-1 lead in the series. Hereês hoping Guy Boucher gets the team focused again, because Boston is too good of a team to come into Game 5 lying down. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson 22 saves isnêt a lot for a shutout, but several were of the spectacular variety. He finally won a game this series, and the Sens did just enough to win. Sens Near-Killer: Brad Marchand He played over 20 minutes, had six shots on goal, and managed to earn three grade-A chances all by himself. Without Andy, this game is very different. Honourable Mention: Bobby Ryan A confident Ryan has turned out to be crucial for Ottawa. Seeing him scoring goals is a great change. Hereês hoping that Ryan has turned a corner, for real.   ",Stanley Cup of Chowder,On the Brink,"First Period: Both teams spent a good portion of the first period just kind of throwing shots on net, neither side had much to give on this first one, but after awhile it appeared the Sens took over the period and began throwing shots on Rask, who steered them all away. Second Period: Boston and Ottawa traded decent shifts back and forth, but Boston had an absolutely fantastic shift from the Moore line that, had it counted, wouldêve gotten them up 1-0! ...But it was called back because Noel Acciari was very much offsides 30 seconds after the goal, and thus the period continued on with Boston and Ottawa just trading opportunities on and off. Onto the third period... Welcome to Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh: Look, the only thing you really need to know about this period was that Bobby Ryan scored 6ish minutes into the period off of a fantastic pass from Erik Karlsson. 1-0 Sens. And Boston, with a Selke finalist, an 80 point getter, a rising star, and Worse than that, they could do nothing in their own end and in the neutral zone, allowing Ottawa to set up their 1-3-1 and slam the door on the game, ending the game at 1-0 and putting Boston within one game of being eliminated in 5 games. Game Notes: They need to win Game 5, their goalscoring needs to be revived. No questions asked. When Rask pitches a .962 SV%, you should be able to win at least 2-1. The 1-3-1 has been solved since at least 2008. The Bruins are better than this (at least when healthy.) Your possession leaders from tonight were: David Backes, Charlie McAvoy, Brad Marchand, Patrice Bergeron, and David Krejci. Colin Miller didnêt look 100%, but thatês to be expected. Heês also barely been with his preferred defense partner of Kevan, so that only really made it worse Charlie McAvoy played out of his mind, as did Brad Marchand, but after the Bobby Ryan goal it wouldnêt have made much of a difference. After that goal the entire team deflated. David Backes played an awful lot like David Backes in stretches but ended up being the leader in CF%. If nothing else, itês clear heês trying. Do or die time, ladies and gentlemen. Next few games basically decide what Boston is made of.  "

Kuraly's second goal of the game at 10:19 of the second overtime gave the Boston Bruins a 3-2 win over the Ottawa Senators in Game 5 on Friday night, avoiding elimination in the first-round series. Charlie McAvoy's shot from the right point was tipped by David Backes and then hit Senators defenseman Erik karlsson 's skate in front of goalie Craig Anderson, and Kuraly backhanded it in. ""I was just at the tail end of (my shift) and the puck lands on my stick and then (I put) it into the back of the net,"" Kuraly said. ""Those are the good ones, you don't get many of those, but hey it bounced on my stick and I'm happy that it did. "" David Pastrnak also scored and Tuukka Rask finished with 41 saves to help the Bruins rally from a 2-0 deficit early in the second period and cut the Senators' lead to 3-2 in the best-of-seven series. Game 6 is Sunday in Boston. Boston nearly won it at 14:25 of the first overtime, but Noel Acciari's apparent goal was waved off due to goalie interference when Kuraly tripped over Anderson. The Bruins challenged the call to no avail. ""We were just battling out there,"" Boston captain Zdeno Chara said. ""We were close and a few denied goals, but that's just part of it and you have to battle through it and keep going and that's what we did. "" Mark Stone and Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored for the Senators, and Craig Anderson stopped 36 shots. Ottawa had two great chances to take the lead in the third as the Bruins took a delay of game and a too many men penalty in the final 6 minutes of the period, but Ottawa managed just two shots on goal. ""We expected a hard-fought, long, grinding, grueling series and that's what we've got,"" Ottawa's Dion Phaneuf said. ""I don't know how to explain it any better than they're pushing, we're pushing and it goes to double overtime and anything can happen. It's disappointing, but we've got to move on the same way that we moved on from the other couple that we won in overtime. "" Before Acciari's near-goal, the Bruins went on the power play on Clarke MacArthur's high-sticking penalty, but couldn't get anything past Anderson. ""We knew it wasn't going to come easy, it hasn't come easy for us,"" Backes said,""and we were going to have to stay with it and stay with it and Tuukka made some huge saves and in the end we were able to tilt the scales in our favor, get that opportunity, make good on it and this is a tight series. "" Ottawa was 0 for 5 with the man advantage, while the Bruins were 0 for 3. Trailing 2-0, Brad Marchand helped cut the lead in half when he took the puck behind the Senators net and made a cross-crease pass to Pastrnak, who beat Anderson short side at 8:40 of the second. Kuraly tied it with his first-ever NHL goal on a bank shot from the side of the net with 2:55 left in the middle period. ""You get the playoffs and there's no lead that's big enough to say that you're going to get away with it,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said. ""It's not because we started playing differently, they just scored. We didn't do anything different. ""It's one of those games that could go either way and it didn't go our way. "" Ottawa scored just 30 seconds into the period to push their lead to 2-0 when the Bruins defense was caught flat-footed. Pageau was able to break in alone and beat Rask through the legs. The Senators took a 1-0 lead in the first period when Mike Hoffman made a great pass to Stone, who slipped behind the Bruins defense and beat Rask on the backhand. An already depleted Bruins lineup took another hit as David Krejci left the game late in the first after a collision with Chris Wideman. The Senators lost Viktor Stalberg in the first overtime and he is considered day-to-day. NOTES: C Chris Kelly was in the Senators lineup for first time, replacing the injured Tom Pyatt. ... Ottawa D Mark Borowiecki (lower body, day-to-day). RW Chris Neil, C Tommy Wingels were healthy scratches. ... The Bruins remained without defensemen Adam McQuaid (upper body), Torey Krug (lower body) and Brandon Carlo (upper body). C Ryan Spooner was scratched as he wasn't 100 percent.  ",Colin4000,Bruins Defeat Senators 3-2 in Double Overtime,"What a heartbreaker. After taking a 2-0 lead and later giving it up, the Ottawa Senators fell to the Boston Bruins in double overtime, extending the series to game six in Boston. Sean Kuralyês two goals proved to be the difference in the contest, extending the Bruinsê season to at least one more game. Still with two more chances remaining to close out the series, the Senators put their best foot forward, putting the pressure on the Bruinsê defence. Both goalies, Craig Anderson and Tuukka Rask, came into the game in top shape, holding the game to as close as it was. The first period began with a small scare for Ottawa, with both Bobby Ryan and Chris Kellyhaving to temporarily leave the ice. Both would soon return though, and help Ottawa with their fast start.  I posted an article on Wednesday about Mark Stoneês struggles, as he was coming into tonight on a nineteen game goal drought. He was hungry to finally score in the playoffs, and tonight he finally got it. Mike Hoffman sent a sweet Karlsson-esque saucer pass from the Senatorsê blue line, which sprung Stone on a breakaway. He deked to the backhand putting Rask on his stomach, and buried the puck to put the Senators on the board first. What a way to break a slump! Not too long after, Chris Wideman had an awkward collision with David Krejci, which although appeared to be knee-on-knee, went unpenalized by the referee. Krejci took the brute force from the play, missing the remainder of the game. First intermission complete, it didnêt take very long for the Senators to double their lead. Viktor Stalberg chipped the puck past a confused Zdeno Chara, which went right to the stick of Jean-Gabriel Pageau who was left all alone on a breakaway. Pageau shot the puck five-hole, which beat Rask and earned him his first point of the playoffs. Pageau chants rang through the sold-out Canadian Tire Centre. Clarke MacArthur had a wide open chance that almost put Ottawa up 3-0. The second round was soon to be ours! In hindsight, we really shouldêve seen coming the events that followed. The team that goes up has never been able to hold their lead in this series, from Ottawa blowing their 1-0 and 3-0 leads in games one and three, to Bostonês 3-1 lead disappearing in game two. Bostonês comeback began 8:40 into the second period. Brad Marchand carried the puck behind the net, and although Craig Anderson was ready for the wraparound, he wasnêt prepared to stop David Pastrnak who was hanging out in the slot. Marchand found Pastrnak, making the game 2-1.  The Sens would pressure the Bruins in their end, although it was one chance that brought the game to a 2-2 tie. Sean Kuraly, who was put in the lineup in place of healthy scratch Ryan Spooner, had some space with the puck behind the Senatorsê net. He tried to tuck it in, although the puck instead bounced off the skate of Chris Wideman and found a hole past Anderson. It was a fluky goal, but it was Kuralyês first in the NHL to officially erase the Sensê 2-0 lead. At this point, shot totals were relatively low for both teams, with Ottawa leading 16-9 at 5v5. Itês incredible how much the Senators have been able to hold down Bostonês offence, limiting them to an insanely low average of 26 shots per game after 60 minutes. For comparison in the regular season, Boston had the second highest average of shots for (33.2), whereas Ottawa was middle of the pack in shots against, on average allowing 30.1. The third frame was quite nerve-racking for Sens fans, as the defence was caught in their end with the Bruins giving Anderson a bit more work. It was a battle of the goalies, however, with neither allowing another goal to slip by. Ottawa had their chances nearing the end of regulation, with the Bruins taking a puck-over-glass and a too-many-men penalty both within the last five minutes. The power play mustered nothing, not showing the effort of a team on the brink of making the second round. The game headed to overtime for the third time this series, with fans hoping for the same outcome as the previous two. An early high-sticking call on Clarke MacArthur raised the intensity, although that quickly died off as the tired teams exchanged icing after icing for the majority of the first overtime. What OT would be complete without a scare, though? Noel Acciari, racing in on a partial breakaway, would partially collide with Craig Anderson, with the puck somehow finding the back of the net. The Bês celebrated, despite the call on the ice being no goal due to goalie interference. After an extensive review, it was confirmed that Acciari interfered with Anderson, although the decision appeared very close. Hereês the footage; you make the call. Another fantastic chance for Boston came later in overtime, although Pageau was able to bail out Craig Anderson and somehow keep the puck from crossing the line. The play was reviewed for Pageau putting his hand over the puck, although nothing was called. If playoff overtime couldnêt be stressful enough, Viktor Stalberg left the ice with 2:18 remaining, although he returned not too long after. Both teams were completely gassed at this point, but the game was yet to be decided. Double overtime would be needed. Ottawa would get the early power play this time, although it looked tired with no good chances coming from it. Ryan Dzingel would have to head to the dressing room, but he too would return quickly. The Senators were getting beat up in this game, absorbing a massive 56 hits while only tossing 39. Kyle Turris received a fantastic feed from Ryan Dzingel to have the chance to end it, although that would be the last of the Senatorsê great opportunities as Sean Kuraly would score his second goal of the game, and of his career, to conclude the marathon. Anderson would make the initial save off Charlie McAvoy from the point, although the rebound would be wide open with zero chance to recover. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson He made 36 saves, often keeping Ottawa in the game with timely stops. None of the Bruinsê goals were particularly of his fault. Honourable Mention: HST (Hoffman, Stone, Turris) Although they werenêt playing on the same line together, the trio of Hoffman, Stone and Turris led the way for Ottawaês offence. Hoffman was dangerous all night, Stone finally broke his slump with a slick goal, and Turris led both teams tonight with eight shots on goal. Sens Killer: Sean Kuraly A night he will never forget, scoring the game-tying and game-winning goals, the first two of his NHL career. Honourable Mention: Tuukka Rask Like Anderson, Rask held the fort for the Bruins, in a game that couldêve easily had a few more goals on both sides.  ",Stanley Cup of Chowder,"Kuraly, Rask Help Bruins Stay Alive In Slugfest, 3-2 (2OT)","It might not have been one of the best playoff games ever, but it was certainly one of the most memorable in recent seasons. The Bruins come-from-behind, 3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators in Game 5 last night had pretty much everything. Letês just take this by period, otherwise weêre going to be here all morning. First Period On balance, this period followed the series script to date pretty well the Bruins were slightly out-chanced in the first frame, and the Senators broke through first on a defensive breakdown by the Bês.  With the puck in the Ottawa zone near the left half-boards, Bruins DMan Joe Morrow pinched in to try and keep the puck in. He succeeded temporarily, before Ottawaês Derick Brassard won it back behind the net. Dominic Moore had rotated back to the left point to cover for Morrow, and Noel Acciari was covering the middle of the ice as the Bruins backed off, so at this point, the Bruins were fine. Unfortunately, that wasnêt the way it stayed Mike Hoffman took a short pass from Brassard, waited just long enough that Moore drifted towards the middle of the ice, and saucered a pass into the seam that neither Moore or Acciari was covering. Kevan Miller was, understandably, caught thinking he must have some help on the left side (Moore should have backed off to the LD position, basically), and the result was that a streaking Mark Stone received Hoffmanês laser-guided pass at the Bruins blue line behind every Bruins skater. Stone converted on the breakaway with a nice move to the backhand his first goal since February and it was one-zip. The other key blow to the Bruins during this frame? A Chris Wideman leg-on-leg hit on David Krejci. Krejciês already been banged up and visibly so, and the Ottawa defenseman, flying in to try and stop a Krejci pass, made no effort to stop his right leg from smashing into Krejciês left when the move Krejci made caused him to slightly overshoot the Bruinsê center. Krejci limped off, and the Bruins announced during the first intermission that he wasnêt returning. Wideman somehow avoided being penalized on the play. Second Period This ended up being a good twenty minutes for the Bruins, but youêd never know it by the way the period began. For the second time in 21 minutes, the Bruins completely hung Tuukka Rask out to dry, this time allowing Jean-Gabriel Pageau a clear path from the red line on in. Pageau went fivehole, and it was 2-0 a mere 30 seconds into the period. Pageau was sprung when, in an effort to keep the puck in the zone, Zdeno Chara made an ill-advised pinch behind Charlie McAvoy and didnêt get the puck, so Viktor Stalbergês rather ordinary breakout pass left Pageau with nothing but open ice. It was the only egregious mistake that Chara would make, en route to somehow logging 36:46 at age 40 (only the inhuman Erik Karlsson played more overall, with 41:51) which included a whopping 7:55 on the Penalty Kill (which was perfect on the night). It was also the last time in the game that the Senators would beat Tuukka Rask, who was nothing short of brilliant overall. The Bruins also would get a gift about five minutes later when Clarke MacArthur couldnêt find the handle on a solid 2-on-1 pass, which easily couldêve been the dagger for Ottawa. That all said, the Bruins still needed to find a way to score. The silver lining of Krejciês departure was that it caused Bruce Cassidy to finally let David Pastrnak take some shifts with Brad Marchand and Patrice Bergeron again the Bruins have needed more out of their Top 6, and, sure enough, the goal that got them back in the game came from this trio. Taking a pass from Bergeron, Marchand circled the net from right-to-left, and fed a perfect backhand dish across to a net-crashing Pastrnak, who made no mistake with the open half of the net. The Bruins had finally solved Craig Anderson for the first time since Pastrnakês Game 3 goal, and it was 2-1 8:40 into the second frame. The Bruins had finally gotten a key marker from their top line. But the playoffs also tend to make unlikely heroes, especially when your teamês desperately trying to get back into a series and the opposing goalieês been hot you take Çem anyway you can get Çem. And Sean Kuraly (in pre-game, we suggested he only played because of a healthy scratch to Ryan Spooner, by the way - multiple sources have now suggested that this line-up decision was NOT a healthy scratch, but that Spooner was not 100% healthy), who had been buzzing on a couple shifts beforehand, played the role of unlikely hero for the Bruins last night. The first of his two goals the first time he scored at the NHL level, mind you was an unlikely goal, too. Taking a cycle pass from David Backes (he and Drew Stafford were sort of cycled through the line-up after Krejci leaving erased their line from existence), Kuraly banked a shot from behind the net off Chris Wide Man, off Craig Anderson, and into the net. 2-2 with three minutes to in the period, and Kuraly celebrated in the hilarious fashion that only a player who just scored his first NHL goal can. The Bruins, still being outshot 19-12 through two, somehow had found new life. Third Period The only period in this game where no one scored a goal (see what I did there?). Both goalies were instrumental in getting this to OT. The run of play itself was incredible lopsided: the Senators didnêt register a SOG for a stretch of 10:14, and then the Bruins almost let Kyle Turris score on a 1-on-4 chance & Dion Phaneuf hit the crossbar. It was with less than six minutes left when things started getting really weird. And, frankly, this game would never stop being bizarre afterwards. With 5:08 remaining in regulation and the score still 2-2, Dominic Moore somehow lifted the puck past a forechecking Senator and over the glass without the puck touching either. Every teamês fans think that their team has a propensity for ill-timed, dubious third period penalties such as Puck Over Glass, but itês pretty undeniable that the Bruins have more of a history than other clubs here, so the familiar sinking feeling that set in seemed appropriate.  However, in a heroic effort by usual suspects on the penalty kill Bergeron, Marchand, Rask, and the pairing of Zdeno Chara and Kevan Miller (who, let it be said, had pretty much as good a game as heês ever had) prevented Ottawa from taking advantage of this lapse. The Bruins were sure to take a boost into OT and... Well, then they took a Too Many Men penalty forty seconds after the PK was over, with 2:28 left in regulation. And it wasnêt the kind of TMM where someone jumps the gun in getting over the boards, or stupidly plays the puck on their way off, it was the kind where Cassidy (who deserves big ups for playing Kuraly, and a gold star for putting 63-37-88 together, but generally coached a pretty miserable tactical game, letting Boucher get Karlssonês pairing on against the Bês weaker units continuously) and the coaching staff somehow forgot how to count and let a sixth Bruin go onto the ice. So, this was the moment where the Bruins doomed themselves, not that first penalty? Well, the endingês already kind of spoiled, but no. Said penalty killers, again, came up big, including a stretch where Patrice Bergeron cleared the puck and denied two attempted zone entries practically by himself. Somehow, after playing 4:00 of the final 5:08 shorthanded, the Bruins made it to Overtime. OT Remember when I said that stuff got weird? Hoo boy. Here we go. First of all, this game never stopped being almost uncannily uneven after a relatively back and forth first five minutes of OT, the Senators flatout dominated the Bruins for much of the first OT frame, and only Tuukka Raskês stellar play this was seriously one of his best games ever, as he saved 41 of 43 shots and, in case I need to remind you, those two goals were BOTH breakaways kept their season alive. Rask was so in the zone that, despite the Bruins having problems getting their possession game together, it never really felt like he wouldnêt bail them out. Finally, the Bruins turned the run of play, and began to take it to Ottawa. Then, 14:25 into the extra frame, Noel Acciari scored on the follow-up of Kuralyês net-drive, and we went home for Game 6. But wait! The referee behind the net made...no signal, despite the puck being in the net, and the officials went to the review as the Bruins celebrated what they thought had been the game-ending goal. Later, weêd find out that the ruling on the ice was No Goal due to _goaltender interference.Ó Kuraly had indeed made contact with Craig Anderson, but no penalty was assessed...so Iêm guessing they meant _incidental contactÓ or...also itês totally possible they have no idea what the hell theyêre doing.  Anyhow, there was, indeed, some incidental contact. Kuraly, after flinging the puck on net, had built up such a head of steam that he couldnêt avoid making contact with Anderson. In the scrum that followed, Acciari touched the puck and a pig-pile of Sens couldnêt stop it from wobbling past the snow-angeling Anderson. And I donêt know, thereês arguments for both rulings here, and basically the fact that apparently the on-ice ruling was _No GoalÓ stood. If the reffing crew had ruled _GoalÓ on-ice, I suspect that wouldêve stood. These three things sum up my take on the play: I do believe that Anderson, after the contact, had recovered enough to voluntarily try to snow-angel the puck under his pads, and, when he did not succeed, thereês a pretty good argument that Kuraly making contact with him had little to do with what happened afterwards.  Thereês also a pretty good argument that a player making contact with a goalie while going full-speed is going to cause a No Goal ruling regardless of the exact chain of events afterwards. There is no _What Was He Supposed To Do?!Ó Clause of either the Goaltender Interference or Incidental Contact rulings. The rules have to do with whether or not the goalie has a chance to take action & make a save, not whether or not the player making contact had limited options (unless an opposing player pushes him into the goalie, which was not the case here). The world would be a better place if this argument was dropped forever. If and Iêm not saying this necessarily was the case here you put yourself in a position where your only course of action is to make contact with the opposing goaltender, you were supposed to make a different decision earlier on that play.  Moving on, it wouldnêt matter! The Bruins ended up with an open net on a play less than a minute later. David Backes, with Anderson down and out of the play, only had to to knock the puck by a suddenly-playing-goalie Pageau, and the game would be over! But wait! First of all, showing the declining puck-skills that heês frequently exhibited this year to a frustrating degree, Backes couldnêt find a way to hit the puck hard enough or less directly at Pageau to score what was a relatively frigging easy goal. Pageau stopped it. And then we went right back to bizarroland. Pageau pretty blatantly covered puck right in front of the Sens goal line, and then pushed it back under Craig Anderson. I saw it. You saw it. My grandmother saw it. The refereeing crew? Nah, somehow they didnêt see it. And, of course, because this is the NHL, where you can review whether someone was offside on a zone entry seven hours before a goal is scored, but you canêt look at whether or not someone blatantly commits a penalty-shot-worthy penalty in the godsdamn crease with the freaking game and the season on the line, the referees extensive review of the play led to...nothing. A lot of people were mad about the previous No Goal call, understandably, but this one was the truly inexplicable horsepucky ruling. How no official on the ice could see that Pageau had covered the puck in the crease is really just beyond me. And if itês one of those cases where itês _not a call the refs will make at the end of a game,Ó then go hire better refs who will enforce the rules. That wasnêt a player being offside by a centimeter, it was a guy saving a goal in an elimination game in a playoff series. The Bruins 100% should have had a chance to win it on a penalty shot vs. Anderson. And you know, really I could probably stand it if one of these things had happened, but both was almost too much to deal with. It felt like the Bruins had earned a break on one of these two plays, at least, and they got nothing.  The game would remain tied, so we went to a second OT period. 2OT At 10:19 of the second OT period, after an hour-and-a-half of knock-down, drag-out hockey and ridiculously stressful situations, Sean Kuraly scored again. This time it was a more conventional goal, tapping in a backhand effort after David Backes had tipped a McAvoy point shot. The Bruins could finally celebrate, taking home a 3-2 win. But wait! Nah, Iêm just messing with you. It really did count this time. Sean Kuralyês the hero of the hour, and Game 6 is in Boston tomorrow at 3 PM.  "

"" MacArthur scored in Game 2 of the series, and then got past David Pastrnakon his way into the Bruins' zone in overtime, tempting the Boston forward into pulling him down from behind. Just 36 seconds into the power play, MacArthur grabbed a puck that deflected off Tuukka Rask and beat him on the rebound for the series-winner. ""It was off his paddle and went right to me. I was just lucky enough to be in the right spot,"" MacArthur said. ""You get opportunities like that to put them away, you've got to put them away. It's just awesome that we were able to. "" The Bruins made the playoffs for the first time in three seasons, rallying after firing the winningest coach in franchise history and the one that led them to the 2011 Stanley Cup title. They went 18-8 after Bruce Cassidy replaced Claude Julien, but lost their last two to finish third - behind Ottawa - in the Atlantic Division. That left them matched up with the Senators in the first round - a bad draw against a team that beat them all four times in the regular season and six straight overall. After winning Game 1, Boston lost three in a row before forcing a fifth game with a double-overtime victory on Friday night. Cassidy, who served out the season as the interim coach, said he""absolutely, 100 percent"" wants to be back. ""That will be determined by management, whether I continue to be the head coach,"" he said. ""And what players will be here will be determined by management. "" The Bruins were hit with three delay of game penalties in the first period for sending the puck over the glass, but on none of those power plays did Ottawa even manage as much as a shot on goal. Instead, Boston took a 1-0 lead with just under two minutes left in the first when Stafford converted on a tripping penalty against Mark Stone. But Ryan tied it for Ottawa on a power play early in the second, then Turris gave the Senators a 2-1 lead about five minutes later. It stayed that way until Bergeron tied it about two minutes into the third. NOTES: The Bruins were without F David Krejci, who injured his knee in a collision with Senators D Chris Wideman in Game 5 on Friday. ... Ryan leads Ottawa with four goals in the playoffs. He also assisted on the game-winner.  ",Ross A,"Sens defeat Bruins in OT, win series 4-2","Itês only the second series win of the past decade, and man does it feel sweet. I was tense for 90% of this game, but now that itês over, Iêm so happy. What a spectacular hockey game. The story before the game was the healthy scratching of Chris Wideman in favour of Fredrik Claesson. Wideman had been a constant all year. But then again, Chris Kelly played in all 82 games and played his first playoff game in Game 5 thanks to Tom Pyattês injury, and Kelly was again scratched (this time in favour of Tommy Wingels) for Game 6. The story of the first period was special teams. The Bruins managed to take three puck-over-glass delay of game penalties, giving Ottawa three great chances to take the lead. (Mercifully, none of the penalties overlapped, because Ottawaês 5-on-3 has been atrocious all year.) The Sensê powerplays went from bad to worse though, with the first one looking alright, the second one not looking great except for Erik Karlsson hitting the post, and the third one seeing the Senators failing to get puck possession in the offensive zone. It was brutal. I was worried that failing to do anything on the powerplay would give Boston momentum, but I was wrong. As the third penalty expired, Mark Stone took a dumb penalty by diving to take the puck, missing, and tripping Sean Kuraly. On the powerplay, the Bruins kept the puck in the zone for a full minute before Drew Stafford nailed a chance into the far top corner. It gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead in a period in which they were outshot 12-6. As the period wound down, Ben Harpur and Sean Kuraly got into a shoving match, sending both to the box. Boston controlled most of the 4-on-4, but Mark Stone got a breakaway chance near the end which Tuukka Raskshut down. It turned out allowing that goal was a blessing in disguise. It used up all of the Bsê momentum, giving Ottawa the chance to plow into the lead to start the second. First Bobby Ryan got a microtip on a Derick Brassard point shot to beat Rask, and then Kyle Turris used a defenceman as a screen to rip a beauty home off the left post. I have no stats to back this up, but I think Turris is the best player on the team at using opposing defencemen as screens. Most players seem to try to avoid players for fear of a block. The Sens then just seemed to shut down the Bruins for the rest of the period. They would send in two forecheckers and clog up the neutral zone, and they couldnêt get anything going. That would be frustrating to watch if I were unlucky enough to be a Bruins fan. Big Mo (NHL 14, 2014) would switch back to Boston to start the third. After an icing call, Ottawa forced a complete change they didnêt really have time for. The Bruins capitalized, with Brad Marchand getting an open shot to the net, and Patrice Bergeron potting the rebound after a bit of a fortunate bounce for him. Ottawa could continue to be hemmed in their own zone and ice the puck, but Boston couldnêt take advantage. It probably wasnêt until eight minutes into the period that Ottawa first gained some pressure, at which point I also realized that Iêd been holding my breath for about that long. It was stressful, to say the least. Late in the third, Boston would get a golden opportunity when Mike Hoffman slashed (and broke) a stick. Some good play by Alexandre Burrows and Zack Smith in particular kept Ottawa in it, and the teams went to overtime after a period in which Ottawa was thoroughly outplayed. Boston looked like a team with its playoff lives in the balance, and Ottawa looked like a team that was just happy to be there. I was definitely hoping things would look different in OT. OT did look different, as luck would have it. The final shot count was 6-0 for Ottawa. Erik Karlsson raced up the ice a few minutes in, forcing David Pastrnak into a holding penalty to avoid a 2-on-1 down low, giving Ottawa a powerplay. The PP hadnêt been firing all game, but it scored when it mattered. Rask got a little too far out of position to cover a cross-crease pass chance for Bobby Ryan, so Ryan hit Clarke MacArthur with the puck in the slot. With the goalie way out of position, MacArthur snapped home the series-clinching goal. What a sweet feeling for all. Sens Hero: Craig Anderson He saved 28 of 30 shots, and held the Sens in a game they had no business winning in the third period. Without him, Game 7 happens. Sens Hero: Clarke MacArthur WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  ",Stanley Cup of Chowder,"Bruins fall to Ottawa in Game 6 OT, 3-2","For this authorês attendance at his first career playoff game - either in fandom or for Stanley Cup of Chowder - the experience could have been better in only one way.  First Period Game 5 hero Sean Kuraly comes out excited, and... immediately fires the puck over the glass, 17 seconds in. The delay of game strategy returns to Bruins hockey. With some early stagnant play, the Bruins iced the puck a handful of times in the first half of the period. They managed to pressure Ottawa in the latter portion and force a few icings the other way. Rather than take more icing penalties, the Bruins decided to spend more time shorthanded, as Joe Morrow and Colin Miller took back-to-back delay of game penalties in with 7:30 and 4:50 to go, respectively. Not wanting to miss out on the fun, Ottawa took a tripping penalty just following their power play, and the Bruins returned the favor with some serious zone time. With McAvoy cycling low carrying the puck, Stafford and Marchand cover the point, and as the puck circled back to Marchand, Stafford slid back to the circle on Craig Andersonês left. Marchand faked a shot and passed the puck to Stafford who wound up, hesitated, and roofed a slapshot from in close over Andersonês right shoulder for the power-play goal. 1-0, Bruins! With just over a minute remaining in the period, Sean Kuraly took his second penalty of the period and draws a roughing from Ottawa defenseman Ben Harpur, sending the end of the first and the start of the second to 4-on-4. Second Period Some good entries and decent shot opportunities for Marchand and Stafford, but they both flubbed their shots, and Stafford only managed to chip a side-of-net backhand on Anderson. Charlie McAvoy took a penalty for colliding with Tommy Wingels, which from press level looked like hip contact, but thatês of course why the game is officiated on the ice and was called for a trip. Derick Brassard pulls his Drew Stafford impression and fires a slapshot from the top of the left circle, which is tipped in by Bobby Ryan for the power-play goal. 1-1 game.  Boston begins to crack the neutral zone, but D canêt step through the stacks of Ottawa players at blue line. Ottawa upped their forecheck and forced a turnover by Stafford; Dzingel chipped the puck to Turris entering the zone and he saunters into the slot, sniping a high wrister over Tuukka. 2-1, Senators. The Bês breakout futility continued for the rest of the period, and though they did a better job of getting the puck deep, no possession time came from it. At least there were no more Delay of Game penalties! Third Period Ottawaês early icing gave the Bruins the opportunity to set up shop in the zone for nearly a full minute, and with some great cycle work below the goal line by all three forwards (Marchand, Bergeron, Pastrnak), the Bruins were able to get the puck high with Ottawa stuck down low. A long pass from Colin Miller landed perfectly on Marchandês tape, and Brad fired a hard shot. Anderson struggled with the rebound, Patrice swatted at the puck for what seemed like a hundred times, and as the puck trickled past the right post, Bergeron pulled it back into the blue paint and buried it. 2-2, BRUINS! The Bês benefited from another Ottawa icing, though no zone time off the faceoff; defensive pairs began to shuffle. Ottawa took a slashing call with 6:26 to go, but the Bês couldnêt capitalize. Another icing call on Ottawa with 4 minutes to go yields a bit more promise, but only for about twenty seconds of zone time. As the clock ticked past two minutes to play, the play settled in a bit with neither team wanting to risk losing late in regulation. In the final minute, Acciari nearly stepped around Karlsson for a partial break, but couldnêt reach his self-pass. The neutral zone ate the rest of this period, and for the fourth time in the series, the Bruins and Senators headed to sudden-death overtime. OVERTIME Holy S#@% this was stressful. Ottawa continued the icing trend early, and for the first few minutes it looked like Boston might strike; three minutes in, and things started to settle down. This really looked like it would take another double OT. The Ottawa chances were close, but the Bruins were getting chances of their own, and eventually the teams would charge up their defense, eventually this would turn into a battle... And then David Pastrnak took a holding penalty, against Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who absolutely skated in front of Pastrnakês path but didnêt make an attempt to interfere with him. Pastrnak tried to sell the non-call, and ended up taking one of his own. Ottawa would capitalize with two forwards stationed to either side of Tuukka Rask and the umbrella worked too well. 3-2, Senators, final score and series win.  Game Notes Three delay-of-game penalties in the first period were amazing...ly bad, and will go down in the record books as the first time a team has taken three in a period. (I think. Iêm not a huge history buff.) Rookie D Charlie McAvoy started to look human in this game, with some scrambling plays and that penalty in the second. Still, the learning curve for this kid will be steep - really looking forward to his contributions next season. The rest of the Bruinsê D were stretched far too thin, especially the heavy-PK crew. Sky and Chris have the analysis. As I said at the opening of the article, though the loss stings, this really was an incredible experience and the atmosphere at TD Garden was electric. Canêt wait to see more playoff hockey next season. (There, I called it.) If you called out sick today to mourn the season, let us know in the comments. Weêre all still dwelling on what might have been, and misery loves company. On a personal note, thank you all for reading - in my first season as a writer here, I really enjoyed your passion, the debates, and being a fan with you. Letês do it again. GO BRUINS.  "

He got a great one. karlsson 's shot from an almost impossible angle beat Henrik Lundqvist with 4:11 left in the third period, sending the Ottawa Senators to a 2-1 victory over the New York Rangers in the opener of their second-round playoff series on Thursday night. karlsson 's first attempt was blocked by Rangers captain Ryan McDonagh, but the second - the shot leaving his tape from below the goal line - somehow found its way past the Swedish goaltender, who had been nearly unbeatable to that point. ""Those are always nice to get,"" Karlsson said. ""And I think that the amount of pucks that we put at the net we deserved one of those. "" It was the last of 43 shots at Lundqvist and the first goal of the playoffs for the Ottawa captain. ""There's three guys in line with that puck and I pick it up, but it just hit me in the head and it's in,"" Lundqvist said. It was karlsson 's first goal and seventh point of the playoffs. The 26-year-old defenseman, who has been playing with a foot injury, also logged more than 28 minutes in the win. Senators coach Guy Boucher was almost at a loss for words to describe a player who he believes is deserving of Hart Trophy consideration as league MVP this season. ""It's been so consistent that I guess I got used to it,"" Boucher said. ""I don't know if that's good or bad, but I don't think you should ever get used to that. I think our fans have to appreciate what we have here. It's more than a star right now. That's what I think is unbelievable. He's a skilled player that became a star and now he's a winner. "" Ryan McDonagh scored for New York, and Lundqvist finished with 41 saves. Craig Anderson stopped 34 shots and Ryan Dzingel scored for Ottawa, which eliminated Boston in six games in the first round. Game 2 is Saturday. The Senators, playing in front of several empty seats, had a chance for a fast start, but went 0 for 3 on the power play during a scoreless first period. The 35-year-old Lundqvist was terrific, especially early on. He made 21 saves in the first, including a pair of stops on Mark Stone during a flurry around the net on Ottawa's first power play. Lundqvist had a 1.70 goals-against average and a .947 save percentage in the first round against Montreal. ""He made some big stops for us and kept it tight and we always know he's going to be there,"" Rangers defenseman Marc Staal said. ""You knew they were going to push in their building in Game 1 and we have to find a way to answer in Game 2. Playoffs come down to a bounce and one shot here or there and Thursday we were on the wrong side of it. "" Anderson wasn't tested nearly as much at the other end, but was forced to hang tough when McDonagh walked past a row of Senators during a New York power play and made an attempt on goal that went wide. The captain of the Rangers made the most of another power-play opportunity in the second, beating Anderson at 7:10 with pesky winger Chris Kreider camped out in front. New York went 1 for 15 with the man advantage in the first round. Slumping through the first half of the middle period, the Sens grabbed momentum by punishing the Rangers with a series of heavy shifts down low in the offensive zone. The speedy Viktor Stalberg nearly scored when he slipped behind the New York defense at one point, but he was turned away. Ottawa finally broke through with another power play - on the second of two minor penalties for rookie Brady Skjei. Lundqvist brushed aside Kyle Turris' shot from the left face-off circle, but the rebound came right to Dzingel and he converted the Sens' 33rd shot. It was more Lundqvist in the third. He denied Clarke MacArthur on a redirection from the slot, and then turned away Dzingel, who had gotten behind the New York defense. Lundqvist snatched his shot with the glove as the Canadian Tire Centre crowd murmured in frustration. NOTES: Dozens of rows in the upper bowl were completely empty, and there was even a noticeable smattering of vacant seats in the lower bowl. The Senators had no comment when asked about the empty seats at the game and the attendance was not announced. The official game sheet said 16,744 fans were in the 19,153-seat arena.  ",Beata Elliott,Sens Defeat Rangers 2-1 in Series Opener,"Game one always feels more important than it really is. Itês not so much that the stakes are high, but rather that the game sets the tone for the rest of the series. It gives us an idea of how the two teams match up, and what we can expect from the next 3-6 games. This first matchup between the Sens and the Rangers was crucial in determining whether Ottawa stood a chance in the series, and whether they even deserved to be where they are now. Many pundits had written the team off pretty much as soon as the matchup had been determined, but then again, they did the same thing in the first round. And as well as Ottawa performed against the Bruins, it wasnêt hard to chalk that up to injuries, bounces, and Boston generally not being a very good team. Now, Iêm not going to get ahead of myself and pretend this one win means that weêre going to win the series. Thereês a lot of hockey left to be played. But what this game did prove to me is that the Sens are not wildly outmatched, as many people seem to think. They can beat the Rangers, if they keep playing like they did tonight. From a Sens perspective, the first twenty minutes went about as well as they could have gone without resulting in a goal. Ottawa set a new franchise record in the playoffs by registering 21 shots on goal in one period - not bad for a team that isnêt exactly known for its offense.  The period was uncharacteristically lively, with some heart-stopping chances on both ends of the rink, many of which were caused by goaltender fumbles. The Ottawa power play looked to be back on track, despite failing to convert on three opportunities. By that I mean that the man advantage looked dangerous and resulted in a few good chances for the Sens. Mark Stone got the best scoring chance of the night, when a rebound ended up in his feet and he couldnêt quite lift the puck in time to beat Lundqvist. I still canêt quite figure out if Stone or Lundqvist is more to blame for the missed opportunity, but it doesnêt really matter anymore since we won the game anyway. Despite how well the Sens outplayed their opponent in the first frame, there was a certain sense of apprehension/despair among fans, and it was all because of one man: Henrik Lundqvist. If this game taught us anything, itês that Hank is the man to beat. If the Rangers win this series, it will be almost entirely because of him. None of the other Rangers looked particularly dangerous. Ottawa eventually figured out how to beat him, but there was definitely a time when we were all starting to lose hope. Of course, it wouldnêt be an Ottawa Senators game if a great period was not followed by a decidedly Not Great one. Clearly invigorated by their goaltenderês performance, the Rangers came roaring back to score the first goal of the series, followed by a scary shift that looked like a Rangers power play but wasnêt. Fortunately for the home team, that would end up being the best Rangers sequence of the night. Ryan Dzingel evened the score shortly afterward, finally scoring on a power play that has so far looked worlds better than the one we saw against Boston. Letês hope this continues and the Sens donêt forget how to score again. And just like that, Ottawa had control of the game. Though the Rangersê speed was on display, Boucherês trap system seemed to be working against their forwards. The Sens went into the third frame in their very favourite position: tied at one. From there, it was pretty smooth sailing. The Sens continued to outplay their opponent, and finally got the game winning goal when the Captain made an absolutely incredible play to sneak the puck past Lundqvist. Erik Karlsson is so good he scores from below the goalline. Heês so good he manages to get the puck into the net without it touching his own player, so that he gets credit for his first goal of the playoffs. This kid is insane. Donêt ever take that for granted, Sens fans. Despite a late surge by the Rangers and an Ottawa penalty that resulted in a brief 6-on-4, the Sens held on to the lead to win game 1. Yes, itês only one game. Yes, Lundqvist terrifies me. Yes, Iêm probably getting way too cocky and everything could very well fall apart in the next few games. But you know what? That was a damn good hockey game, and itês a great feeling to know that our team stands a chance in this series, after hearing for a week that weêre lucky to be in the second round at all. Letês enjoy it. Sens Hero: Erik Karlsson What more is there say about this man? He is absolutely insane, and we are all lucky that we get to watch him play all the time. Sens Hero: Ryan Dzingel That goal was a long time coming. Letês hope Dzingelês finally found his scoring touch. Honourable Mention: Viktor Stalberg He didnêt register any points, but Stalberg was all over the ice. I was very impressed with his game. Sens Zero: Cody Ceci I hate to complain about him all the time, but he was just awful tonight. He and Phaneuf both looked completely unable to handle the Rangersê speed, and Ceci made a few very noticeable mistakes. At this point, itês very hard to justify keeping him in over Wideman. Sens (Almost) Killer: Henrik Lundqvist I sense that this is going to become a problem.   ",Blue Shirt Banter,Late Senators Bounce Dooms Rangers In Game 1,"The New York Rangers fell to the Ottawa Senators by a final score of 2-1, in the opening game of the second round this evening. As usual, Henrik Lundqvist was dominant and turned aside the early surges from the Senators during the first period. The Rangers were probably fortunate to remain scoreless after their showing in the first period, and a lot of that was thanks to Henrik Lundqvist. After only scoring one power play against the Montreal Canadiens, the Rangers needed to find a way to jump start their special teams early in this series. Thankfully, the Rangers were able to breakthrough on their third power play nearing the midpoint of the game.  The Rangers did an excellent job of generating quick puck move, before Ryan McDonagh rifled a wrist shot past Craig Anderson from the blue line. Chris Kreider did an excellent job of providing the screen in front, and the Rangers found themselves with the first lead of the night.  Unfortunately, that lead would only last until the end of the period where the Senators found the answering goal. The goal came on Ottawaês power play as well, with Ryan Dzingel finishing off a rebound following a scramble off to the side of Henrik Lundqvist. Lundqvist was unable to reach over for the rebound, and Dzingel beat him just under the crossbar to make it a 1-1 game.  The Rangers obviously needed a response in the third period, and while they had their chances, it was Craig Andersonês turn to steal the spotlight. He made two ridiculous saves in the third period, with one robbing Michael Grabner and another point blank glove save on Brendan Smith.  With under five minutes remaining in regulation, the Senators caught a fortunate bounce that wound up being the decider. Erik Karlssonês shot from the right corner of the goal line hit Lundqvist in the shoulder, and fell into the net at the 15:49 mark. It was just a ridiculous bounce that fell in the Senators favor, and was considered the game winner.  As Joe mentioned on Twitter after the game, the good news here is that this probably the best the Rangers will see from the Senators in this series. On the flip side, the Rangers arenêt going to be as bad as they at points in this game, so thereês still a while to go in this series. The Rangers will have an opportunity on Saturday afternoon to swing this series back to Madison Square Garden all knotted up at 1-1.  "

Pageau scored a career-high four goals, including the winner 2:54 into the second overtime to lift the Senators to a 6-5 victory over the New YorkRangers on Saturday, giving Ottawa a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. ""I think I closed my eyes when I shot and thankfully it went in,"" Pageau said of the winner. ""I was on a cloud and it's a moment I'll never forget. "" The 24-year-old Ottawa native also scored twice in the final 3:19 to tie the score. He tipped Zack smith 's shot past Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist to pull the Senators to 5-4 and then tied it by deflecting a shot by Kyle Turriswith 1:02 remaining. ""That last deflection I don't even know how he did that,"" Lundqvist said. ""The way he angled the stick he didn't even know he hit the net I think. "" Pageau scored again 2:54 into the second OT, snapping in a shot during a 2-on-1 rush alongside Tommy Wingels. Pageau is the first Senator ever with four goals in a playoff game. ""I thought his quota was full,"" captain Erik Karlsson said when asked if Pageau was his pick for the double OT winner. After his OT score, Pageau slid into the end boards, skated to the left corner and was swarmed by teammates. Wingels stopped to scoop the puck out of the goal before joining the pile. ""It's just great to see him get rewarded: four-goal game, overtime winner. It's just a legendary game,"" teammate Dion Phaneuf said. The Senators have a 2-0 series lead for just the second time in franchise history, and first since the 2007 Eastern Conference final against Buffalo. They have never swept a four-game series. Marc Methot and Mark Stone also scored for Ottawa, and Craig Andersonhad 43 saves. Brady Skjei had two goals for New York, his second putting the Rangers up two 5:10 into the third period. Michael Grabner, Chris Kreider and Derek Stepan also scored and Lundqvist stopped 28 shots. ""We played well enough to win this game, there's no question about it so it's really tough to lose this one,"" Lundqvist said. ""Clearly they've gotten the bounces in the first two games. We've just got to go home and regroup. It's a really tough loss being up a couple goals, especially late in the game. "" The series heads to New York for Game 3 on Tuesday night. Ottawa lost Clarke MacArthur to injury and won despite letting Grabner and Stepan score short-handed. After karlsson 's unlikely tally late in regulation lifted Ottawa in Game 1, the Senators came out flying early in Game 2. Canadian Tire Centre appeared near capacity after more than 2,000 seats were left empty in the opener two nights earlier. Ottawa had three straight power-play chances early, but it didn't even manage a shot on goal in that time, although Karlsson did hit a post. Mike Hoffman fired a sloppy pass that was picked off by Kevin Hayes at one point and MacArthur dropped another feed to no one in particular. Grabner got his goal during Ottawa's second power play. Stone couldn't corral a puck that sailed around the boards, and Jesper Fast and Grabner sped away on a successful 2-on-1. Pageau tied it with 6:01 left in the first, his second of the playoffs. The Ottawa native picked off Dan Girardi's pass in the neutral zone, then beat Lundqvist. Kreider and Stepan both scored in the middle of the second, then Ottawa pulled within 3-2 on Methot's goal with six minutes to play in the period. New York re-upped its lead when Skjei sent a seemingly harmless point shot toward goal that caromed off phaneuf 's leg in front. The puck sailed right between anderson 's pads, and the goalie raised his arms in frustration after not having seen it. Stone got one past Lundqvist less than two minutes into the third, but the Rangers came back a few minutes later to increase the deficit back to two on Skjei's second of the game and fourth of the playoffs. Karlsson, who's been excelling this spring despite two hairline fractures in his left foot, briefly went to the Ottawa dressing room in apparent discomfort during the middle frame. He returned, but then took a hard hit into the end boards from Ryan McDonagh as the second period expired. MacArthur also got a heavy check from the Rangers captain late in the first period. He played two shifts in the second and didn't return. The 32-year-old missed most of the last two seasons with concussion problems. Senators coach Guy Boucher said MacArthur""aggravated"" something from Game 1, but was already feeling better afterward. Karlsson, who played through two hairline fractures in his left foot in the first round, also briefly left the game and looked to be in discomfort throughout. He still logged more than 37 minutes, notched an assist and fired eight attempts on goal. NOTES: Pageau has two career postseason hat tricks. He scored 12 goals in 82 games for Ottawa this season, and this was his first career overtime score.   ",Colin4000,"Sens Take 2-0 Series Lead, Win 6-5 in 2OT","On a Saturday afternoon at the Canadian Tire Centre, Sens fans filled the arena to witness game two of the Ottawa Senators vs New York Rangers. And what a game it was. It was one of those games you could make a movie of. The jaw-dropping plays, the back and forth chances, the missed opportunities, and of course, the epic comeback to top it off. In what will probably go down as one of the craziest playoff games in Senators history, the good guys came out on top 6-5 in double overtime, to take a commanding 2-0 series lead. For an afternoon game, the pace started off higher than expected. Both teams would exchange chances early, although the Rangers would break that up by taking three consecutive penalties in the first 10 minutes. The Sensê power play units had trouble mustering anything, despite being handed ample opportunity to go up early. Instead of scoring on the power play, it was the opposite that occurred, as the Rangers that opened the scoring shorthanded. A puck bounce over Mark Stoneês stick lead to a 2-on-1 for the Rangers. Jesper Fast slid the puck past Dion Phaneuf right to Michael Grabner, who put the Rangers up 1-0.  The play would settle down for a bit after the penalties, until Ottawa scored to tie it back up. Dan Girardi made the questionable move to pass the puck to nobody, which was then picked up by Jean-Gabriel Pageau. Pageau rushed down the side, and shot the puck past Henrik Lundqvist from a sharp angle. Todayês game was questionable for Lundqvist, which is something that I doubt weêll see often for the remainder of the series. Either way, period one concluded 1-1, with shots on goal a mere 9-6 for the Rangers. The second period can essentially be broken down into two parts: the Anderson highlight reel, and then the opposite. Period two has been consistently poor for the Senators so far in the playoffs, and this one was no different. The Rangers peppered the Sens in shots throughout, with Craig Anderson making some spectacular saves in the process. Hereês the highlight of the bunch: The ten minute mark is when the switch flipped, however, as the Rangersê dominance started to pay off. Chris Kreider was up first, who turned and fired a puck high that beat Anderson over his shoulder. Next would be Derek Stepan, who on an undefended shorthanded rush somehow found a breakaway to put the Rangers up 3-1. With New York scoring twice shorthanded and up by two, the game was beginning to look out of grasp already. The Sens would answer back with one, though, as Mike Hoffman zoomed end-to-end past three Rangers players to get a chance in close. Lundqvist would make the stop, although the rebound was right there for a pinching Marc Methot (!!!) who scored to cut New Yorkês lead in half. It was Methotês first goal of the season, with his last being on March 19th of last season. New York would get back their two goal lead soon after, as Brady Skjei feathered a puck from the point towards the net, which somehow beat Anderson clean. It couldêve been because of Marc Methot tying up the Rangers player in front and screening Andy, although it was a soft goal nevertheless. The Rangers sustained their lead to the end of the period, although Sens fans still had hope of a potential comeback. Period three began at four-on-four because of a late flurry of high-sticks in the second frame, and Ottawa would find the back of the net not long before it would expire. Kyle Turris was taken out of the faceoff circle, forcing Mark Stone to take the draw. Stone would win it back to Phaneuf, who sent a shot wide that deflected back out front. It led right to the stick of Mark Stone, who would shoot the puck past a stunned Lundqvist. All of a sudden, Ottawa was down by only one with over 18 minutes remaining. The back and forth continued, though, as Brady Skjei (pronounced Shea) would score his second of the game off a fantastic individual effort. Stone and Turris first rushed down on a 2-on-1, which was Skjei interrupted with his stick. The Rangers rushed back with the quick counterattack, and Skjei ended up scoring with a point blank shot on Anderson. It was a weak goal for Andy, although not enough credit can be given to Skjei for the amount of work he did on that play. More chances would be exchanged at both ends, with the Rangers desperately trying to protect their lead. Fans started to leave to beat the traffic with five minutes left, and man did they mess up big time. With just over three minutes remaining on the clock, the Senators put some extra force on the gas pedal, gaining some sustained offensive zone pressure. Ottawa won a puck battle along the boards which went to Zack Smith at the point, who took a shot hoping to get a deflection. He got it, as Jean-Gabriel Pageau got his second goal of the game to bring the Sens back within one. Now desperate to complete the comeback, Anderson left the crease for the extra attacker. Erik Karlsson would work the point, and send a pass to Kyle Turris who took a shot. The puck found a stick in front which soared past the short side _KingÓ Henrik, a stick that belonged to none other than Jean-Gabriel Pageau. The chants roared throughout the CTC for the Pageau hat trick, as it was now a tie game. Five to five, headed to overtime. The first OT was a hard fought duel between both teams, although it would end still locked in a tie. Mark Stone and Kyle Turris both had chances to end it, as well as one for Rick Nash on the other side. The stress levels felt the highest theyêve been all playoffs. Mike Hoffman took a high stick to the face late that went uncalled, returning patched up to begin the double OT. The second overtime wouldnêt last as long as the first, as none other than Jean-Gabriel Pageau would send fans home to complete the epic comeback. With Derek Stepan caught high, Alex Burrows would chip the puck up to Pageau, who was set free on a 2-on-1. With Tommy Wingels there as a passing option, Pageau opted to shoot, firing a laser past Lundqvist in heroic fashion for the game winning goal. Sens Hero: Jean-Gabriel Pageau Four goals. Four freaking goals! Pageau, youêre a hero. Honourable Mention: Jean-Gabriel Pageau Did I mentioned that he scored four goals? Including the game-tying goal? Including the game-winning goal? His performance tonight was nothing short of legendary. Imagine how many he wouldêve had if we played the Habs! Honourable Mention: Tommy Wingels This oneês more of a personal choice, although I thought Wingels had a fantastic game, having many good looks at the net and doing a great job of setting things up in the offensive zone.  Sens Zero: The Defence There were WAY too many defensive zone breakdowns this game, especially from Phaneuf and Ceci. Claesson and Harpur had their fair share too, mostly coming in the second period. Shots ended 48-34 Rangers, with the opposition getting the bulk of high-danger chances as shown in the heat map below. Sens Killer: Brady Skjei On a Rangers blue line filled with slow and aging veterans, Skjei provided them with a speedier and more skilled player who was nothing short of outstanding. He was breaking up odd man rushes left and right, and added his two goals in the process. ???: Craig Anderson He had his moments for sure, although a couple of the goals he let in were pretty weak. On a night where Henrik Lundqvist was also not fully on his game, the Sensê netminder was also looking a bit shaky. Also, somebody fasten him to the net! Additional Note:  Clarke MacArthur left the game late in the first period, and did not return. Itês reportedly because of something that has nothing to do with his head, and itês not obvious which play it was that made him exit. Letês hope Clarkeês alright for game three.   ",,,

Zuccarello had a goal and an assist in the first period and the Rangers went on to a 4-1 victory Tuesday night that cut the Senators' lead to 2-1 in the Eastern Conference semifinal series. Michael Grabner, Rick Nash and Oscar Lindberg also scored, and Henrik Lundqvist stopped 26 shots. Looking to avoid falling into a 0-3 series hole and with the home crowd buzzing from the singing of the national anthems, the Rangers came out aggressive from the start. They outshot the Senators 15-5 in the first period while building a 2-0 lead. ""We played a solid first period and we came out strong,"" Zuccarello said. ""I think that we set the tone right away. "" The Rangers have won three straight playoff games at Madison Square Garden after losing six straight on home ice, including Game 3 of the first round against Montreal. ""There's no doubt we played a strong game,"" New York coach Alain Vigneault said. ""We were able to score a couple, get early pace and we were able to bring it home and win the game. "" Zuccarello got the crowd fired up when he got the Rangers on the scoreboard 5:31 into the game. Mika Zibanejad brought the puck up the right side, came around the back of the Ottawa net while fighting off a defender and sent a pass in front to Zuccarello, who fired it past goalie Craig Anderson for his 11th career playoff goal. Grabner made it 2-0 with 6:36 left in the opening period. Zuccarello sent the puck along the boards on the left side behind the Ottawa net and Grabner beat Anderson and defenseman Ben Harpur to get it. He then came out and put in a wraparound before Anderson could recover. ""I was just trying to get it deep,"" Zuccarello said. ""It was a lucky play and a good job by him, reading it and stealing the puck there. "" Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who had four goals in Ottawa's 6-5 double-overtime win in Game 2, scored again for the Senators, and Anderson finished with 26 saves. ""The game was lost in the first period,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. ""They were ready, they were hungry, they were desperate and we didn't match that at all, that's it. "" Game 4 is Thursday night. Ottawa came out with more intensity in the second period, getting the first three shots of the period. The Senators had a 12-9 advantage on shots in the middle period but fell further behind. Lundqvist, who leads all goalies with 289 saves in the playoffs, made a nice stick save in the opening minute of the second on Pageau, and both goalies made some nice stops through the middle of the period to keep the score 2-0. ""We didn't give up that much,"" Lundqvist said. ""It felt like we were in control for the most part and played a really smart game. ... I think everybody felt like we played a really strong game when we needed it the most here. "" Nash then increased the Rangers' lead with his 15th career postseason goal - third this year - with 7:39 remaining in the middle period. After Senators defensemen Erik Karlsson and Harpur collided near center ice, Derek Stepan brought the puck down the middle and passed it to Nash, who fired it past Anderson from the left circle. Lindberg made it 4-0 with 1:43 left in the period. J.T. Miller fought off a defender along the left side, skated in toward the net and passed it to Lindberg, who fired it over the glove of a sliding Anderson from the right side. That gave the Rangers a goal from each of their four lines. ""That's huge, especially in the playoffs you need every line kind of going,"" Nash said. ""Tonight we had that and it was obviously a difference maker. "" Pageau then spoiled Lundqvist's shutout bid just 32 seconds later as he got a backhanded pass from Bobby Ryan from behind the net and scored his sixth of the postseason. ""They obviously played with a lot more desperation than we did from the start of the game,"" Karlsson said. ""We just couldn't catch up at the end of the day. They started better and that's why they won this game. "" The Rangers have won at least one game in 21 straight postseason series since being swept by New Jersey in the first round in 2006, setting a franchise record. The previous mark of 20 was set from the quarterfinals vs. Boston in 1970 to the quarterfinals vs. St. Louis in 1981. NOTES: Ryan left the game in the third period because of a lower-body injury. Senators forward Zack Smith (upper body) missed the final two periods. ... Zibanejad's assist on Zuccarello's goal was his team-high seventh point this postseason. ... The Rangers have scored first in each game this series. ... New York is outscoring its opponents 12-4 in the second periods this postseason. ... The Senators' first eight playoff games this postseason were all decided by one goal.  ",Beata Elliott,"Sens Drop Game 3 to Rangers, 4-1","They just canêt make it easy, can they? The Senators headed into New York on an emotional high, after thoroughly dominating game one of their second round series, and stealing game two in spectacular fashion. With an opportunity to take a commanding 3-0 series lead, we all knew it would have been a challenge for the Sens to match the Rangersê urgency. This was by far the Sensê worst game of the playoffs, just as it was the Rangersê best. Kind of the opposite of game one, in which Ottawa played out of their minds and New York was extremely flat. It sucks to lose, and it would have been nice to go up 3-0, but we all knew it couldnêt be that easy. Letês not panic yet: I have faith that the Sens will bounce back with a solid performance in game 4. The first period was not even remotely close, as the Rangersê speed was on full display throughout the entire 20 minutes. The famous neutral zone trap was nowhere to be found, as both teams played an exciting, wide-open brand of hockey. In other words, they were playing Rangers hockey, not Senators hockey. By the time Mats Zuccarello opened the scoring off a beautiful feed from some guy called Mika Zibanejad, Ottawa was already in survival mode. It seemed inevitable that New York would take a big lead early in the game, and thatês exactly what they did. Credit where credit is due: the Rangers played their butts off, and for most of the game looked far superior to the exhausted and uninspired Senators team. I heard a rumour the Sens all ate chicken parms before the game, and though Iêm almost certain it was #FakeNews, they definitely looked like it tonight. The second Rangers goal came later in the first period, when Michael Grabner took advantage of a questionable play by Ben Harpur behind the net, and tucked a wraparound past Anderson.  Now, letês be clear on one thing here: Yes, Anderson had a fantastic game overall, and no, we canêt fault him for a loss in which his team played the worst hockey theyêve played since the end of the regular season. However, Andy looked very bad on that one goal, and I can definitely understand why a lot of fans are mad at him for it. Anderson has had two very obvious holes in his game for years: he is bad at handling the puck, and extremely bad at wraparounds. The fact that he has not improved in either of these areas is very, very frustrating. Has he not identified these as problems in his game? Has he not tried to work on them? And if he has, why have we not seen any improvement? I adore Craig Anderson and I know that he bailed this team out many times in this game. But come on, man. The second period wasnêt quite as bad as the first, thankfully. The teams traded power play opportunities, with one teamês special teams looking significantly better than the otherês (Iêll let you guess which one Iêm talking about). Zack Smith left the game with an upper body injury, and it doesnêt look like heêll be back for game 4.  New York took a 3-0 lead when Erik Karlsson collided with Mark Stone, leaving Marc Methotalone to defend a 2-on-1. Methot defended the rush well by taking away the pass, but Rick Nashês shot got past Anderson. It didnêt take long for the Rangers to score again and take a crushing 4-0 lead. For the first time in the 2017 playoffs, a Sens game was actually looking like a blowout. Ottawa did get a little bit more wind in their sails toward the end of the frame, however, courtesy of none other than Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who has now scored the last four Senators goals. And people say weêre too dependent on Erik Karlsson. Of course, I cannot mention that Pageau goal without talking about the absolutely filthy pass from Bobby Ryan to set it up. Iêm not going to call it the nicest assist of the playoffs, because Erik Karlsson exists, but it was definitely up there. I might even call it the best non-Karlsson assist.  The amazing thing about this Senators team is that their games are never really over until theyêre over. So even though this clearly wasnêt their night, even though the Rangers were absolutely on fire, there was still a tiny shred of hope. A comeback wasnêt impossible, after all. Theyêd done that kind of stuff before. (There is a joke to be made here about Ontario teams, original six teams and 4-1 leads, but I will not stoop to make it seeing as we didnêt come back after all.) To the Sensê credit, the third period was much better than the other two, and Ottawa did have a few decent scoring chances that might have gone in against a weaker goaltender. Unfortunately, it wasnêt enough, and Ottawa never even came close to tying the game. We should all consider ourselves lucky it was only 4-1 and not something more embarrassing. Itês also important to mention that Bobby Ryan left the game with an apparent injury. Before the playoffs, this might not have been a very big deal, but Bobby has been one of the Sensê best performers these last few weeks, and itês a huge blow to the lineup if heês going to miss a few games. It was a bad game, but those things happen sometimes. I trust in this teamês ability to rebound, and I have faith that theyêll show up on Thursday. This should serve as a nice wake up call. It was never going to be easy, after all. Notable Performances Quick note: after a few of you objected to our use of the term _ZeroÓ in our recaps, weêve decided to switch to a nicer term.  The Good: Mike Hoffman He didnêt get on the scoreboard, but I thought Hoffman looked very good out there, especially compared to the rest of the team. He had a number of good looks at the net, and made an excellent defensive play in the third period to help shut down a Rangers 2-on-1.  The Good: Jean-Gabriel Pageau Seriously, what is with this kid? Is it the chicken parmesan? Is it the big stage? Does he see a team wearing bleu blanc rouge and just fly into a rage? Whatever it is, I love it and him. The (Mostly) Good: Craig Anderson I went over this earlier in the recap, but I thought Anderson turned in a stellar performance despite the one bad goal. The Bad: Ben Harpur I feel bad for the guy because heês been given some tough assignments that he hasnêt quite been up to, but this definitely wasnêt his best game. He definitely doesnêt deserve all the blame for the result because none of his teammates were particularly good either, but Iêd certainly be in favour of playing Wideman over him at this point. Sens Killer: Mika Zibanejad He was all over the ice tonight. I miss him. You guys might not want to look at these next two charts. ",Blue Shirt Banter,Rangers Leap Back Into Series With 4-1 Win In Game 3,"After dropping the first two games of this series and falling in a 2-0 hole, the New York Rangers responded in a big way this evening. They not only defeated the Ottawa Senators 4-1, but they also leaped back into this series in dominating fashion. Right from the opening puck drop, the Rangers attacked the Senators, and just kept coming in waves. Henrik Lundqvist didnêt have a difficult game in net tonight, but there were a few occasions where he was forced to make a big save. One of the biggest takeaways from tonightês game was all four lines contributing on the scoresheet in dominating fashion. Alain Vigneault appeared to learn from his mistakes in Game 2 after shortening the bench, and the entire lineup responded accordingly. Itês also worth mentioning that the usage of the defensemen tonight played a big part in the Rangers play. Itês no secret that Marc Staal and Nick Holden have been the two weakest links on defense thus far, and tonight they were sheltered heavily. Ryan McDonagh, Dan Girardi, Brendan Smith, and Brady Skjei were all ahead of them in ice time, and it was fairly evident how much cleaner the Rangers were in their own zone as a result. With their backs against the wall tonight, the Rangers needed some early positive reinforcement in this game, and they received just what the doctor ordered. Just five minutes into the first period, Mats Zuccarello finished off a beautiful centering feed from Mika Zibanejad, and sent Madison Square Garden into a frenzy.  The Rangers continued to pressure the Senators following the opening goal, and eventually forced Craig Anderson into a costly mistake. Michael Grabner was able to beat Anderson behind the net while he was playing the puck, and stuffed the puck into the empty net after forcing the turnover. Anderson never recovered after coughing up the puck, and Grabner had a yawning net to shoot on. Following a dominating opening period, the Rangers carried over their strong play to the second period where they added another pair of goals. Rick Nash started it all off with a filthy wrist shot on a partial breakaway, and gave the Rangers a massive 3-0. Oscar Lindberg quickly made that a 4-0 lead a short time later after J.T. Miller carved through the Senators defense, and fed it to Lindberg on the far post.  The pass left everyone in the dust, including Anderson, and Lindberg rifled the puck over the sprawled out goaltender. About 30 seconds after Lindbergês tally, Jean-Gabriel Pageau made his presence known yet again, and cut the Rangers to 4-1 off of a ridiculous behind the back feed from Bobby Ryan. With a three goal lead firmly in their possession, the Rangers completely shut down the game in the third period, and kept the Senators off of the scoreboard. The Rangers desperately needed a win coming into this game, and they certainly delivered in a big way. Suddenly the pressure shifts back to the Senators, as they look to prevent the Rangers from swinging this series back to Ottawa all knotted up at two. Game 4 will take place on Thursday, and the Rangers will certainly need a similar effort to tie this series back up.  "

Lindberg scored two goals, Glass had two assists and the Rangers beat the Senators 4-1 on Thursday night to tie their Eastern Conference semifinal series at two games apiece. ""I think our line has been doing a really good job, getting pucks back from the forecheck,"" Lindberg said. ""We had two good chances today and we were able to bear down. "" Kreider and Nick Holden also scored for the Rangers, and Henrik Lundqvisthad 22 saves. Kyle Turris scored for Ottawa, and Craig Anderson made 17 saves before being replaced by Mike Condon for the third period. Condon finished with nine stops. ""They are a good hockey team. They came out and played their game to a T,"" Anderson said. ""Had their fans and the momentum. We weren't able to get anything going. "" Senators star defenseman Erik Karlsson also left the game after the second period with an injury. Karlsson played during the first round with two microfractures in one of his feet from blocking a shot late in the regular season. Coach Guy Boucher said he expects both Anderson and Karlsson to play in Game 5 on Saturday at Ottawa. ""We felt it was better for him to keep him off the ice in the (third) period,"" Boucher said of Karlsson. ""He could've come back, but we just wanted to make sure. He has a lower-body injury. "" Lindberg also scored the Rangers' final goal in their Game 3 win, with Glass picking up an assist. Glass, a forward who was scratched in the first two games of the series, has brought an edge to the team. ""Look at these assists,"" Glass said. ""They are not exactly playmaking assists. They are just kind of the gritty, grinding game I bring. Sometimes it ends up in the back of the net. "" Rangers coach Alain Vigneault has appreciated the balanced scoring. ""Definitely tonight Oscar's line came up big for us with a couple of big plays,"" Vigneault said. ""Tanner is just playing disciplined, smart hockey and that's what he needs to do. "" The game got physical in the third period as the teams combined for 78 penalty minutes, with the majority of that coming in the final minute. Lundqvist has stopped 48 of his past 50 shots after allowing six goals in the Senators' double-overtime win in Game 2. The Rangers have won four consecutive home games this postseason. ""I think it's the last couple of games,"" Lundqvist said. ""It's not a one-man show here. It's about four lines doing everything right and that's what you need this time of the year. "" Lindberg scored both of the Rangers' second-period goals. Glass blocked Ben Harpur's shot and Michael Grabner grabbed the loose puck and broke in with Lindberg, who scored on a one-timer at 2:01. Glass also helped set up Lindberg's next goal. He outworked Senators defenseman Cody Ceci for the puck behind the Ottawa net and sent it to the boards. J.T. Miller grabbed the loose puck and passed to Lindberg at the point for a 3-0 lead at 15:54. Kreider made it 4-0 with a power-play goal at 10:45 of the third. Turris scored at 13:34, but the Senators had trouble generating sustained pressure against Lundqvist and were sloppy with the puck at times. ""We've got to hit the net,"" Boucher said. ""Whenever we got chances, we didn't capitalize. "" For the second consecutive game, the Rangers controlled the first period. In Game 3, they scored the first two goals and outshot Ottawa 15-5. On Thursday, they outshot the Senators 11-7 and opened the scoring again. Holden led a breakout from the defensive zone and sent a pass to Kevin Hayes at center ice. Hayes passed back to Holden along the left wing and he broke in toward the net and beat Anderson with a wrist shot that went over his right pad at 14:04. The Rangers have scored the first goal in each game of the series. ""They played well at home for their two games and we played at home for our two games and we've got a series,"" Boucher said. NOTES: Through four games, the Rangers have led for 149:56, have been tied for 108:47 and have trailed for 4:11. ... Lundqvist earned his 61st playoff win to tie Tom Barrasso for 13th on the NHL's career list. ... Senators Fs Bobby Ryan and Zack Smith returned to the lineup after leaving Game 3 with injuries. D Chris Wideman and F Tom Pyatt both made their debuts in the series. D Fredrik Claesson and F Tommy Wingels were scratched. ...

",Trevor Shackles,Senators Set Record for Most Odd-Man Rushes Allowed in 4-1 Loss,"If you had told me last week that this series would be tied 2-2 after four games, I would have been content with that. But Iêm not happy with how it actually transpired. There arenêt many good things to say about tonightês game, and Iêm sorry if this is going to be too negative for your taste. To preface everything, this series is far from over. They have two out of the last three games at home, and itês certainly possible to bounce-back from two bad games. But even the strongest optimist can not have many positive thoughts from tonight. Game 3 between the Senators and Rangers was a scheduled loss, and I donêt think too many fans were upset with the 4-1 result. Game 4 was a different story though. Everyone expected Ottawa to win this one, because blowing a 2-0 lead and putting the series back at square one was not going to be acceptable.  Well, the Rangers felt like it would be unacceptable for them to lose as well, and it showed. New York was the better team tonight, and it wasnêt even close. These past two games, Ottawa hasnêt even been competitive, which we could not have said about any of their previous playoff games. After a terrible performance in game 3, youêd hope that Ottawa would come out hard in the first period. But that kind of play did not happen in the first 20 minutes. The shot attempts were actually 20-18 for the Senators, but it certainly did not feel that way. Ottawa never seemed to get fully set in the offensive zone, and their best chance ended in a broken stick from Erik Karlsson.  Perhaps if the score had been 0-0 after the first, it wouldnêt have seemed so bad. However, Nick Holden made sure the Rangers took the lead first. The video doesnêt fully show it, but it all started with a Mark Stone giveaway in the offensive zone. Itês discouraging to see him make so many mistakes these playoffs, but thereês no chance heês 100% healthy. Having said that, the puck did bounce up on him, so itês not as if it was an easy play. As the game progressed, things did not get much better. Ottawa had a few more chances, but it seemed like every time New York came down the ice they were on an odd-man rush. After an ill-advised shot from Ben Harpur, Oscar Lindbergdoubled the Rangers lead. The Senators powerplay looked lifeless, and although there were a few glimpses of resuscitation, they could not get any sustained momentum. There were a few more odd-man rushes, and Ottawa could not string together a few clean passes in a row.  To say it was frustrating is an understatement. Then, somehow it got worse. Cody Ceci shot the puck up to the point in the defensive zone, and Lindberg scored his second goal on a shot that should be stopped 10 out of 10 times. At first I thought Tanner Glass got a piece of it, but no. Anderson most likely got distracted by Glassê blade, but thatês no excuse. After 40 minutes, Ottawa was at their lowest point of the series.  To begin the period, Anderson was pulled, and Mike Condon came in relief. Not only that, Erik Karlsson left the bench and did not play the rest of the game. Considering he was playing through a broken foot before this, itês not a good sign that he was unable to play through something.  Hopefully Boucher just realized that Ottawa probably wasnêt going to come back, and that Karlsson could use the rest. Because if he canêt play the rest of the series, then the series shifts in a big way towards New York.  (UPDATE: Looks like he was just resting him): The Senators had a bit of life in the third, but it was way too little too late. Chris Kreider would actually extend their lead to four on the power play before Kyle Turris finally put Ottawa on the board to make it 4-1. Itês a shame that Turrisê goal didnêt matter, because it was quite the wicked shot. They were better in the third period, but that was to be expected while being down by three goals. Even with score effects though, they werenêt as good as they needed to be.  In the end, the final score was 4-1 once again, but this time, the fanbase had a much different reaction to the loss. Itês obviously not impossible for Ottawa to regroup from these losses, but these two games in New York made them look like a non-playoff team. If they had been competitive and lost 3-2 in both of these games, I wouldnêt be nearly as upset.  But instead, they allowed an exorbitant amount of odd-man rushes, could not keep any offensive pressure, nor did they have any answer for the Rangers speed. All in all, it was a frustrating night with not a lot of good things happening. If youêre looking for a silver lining, like I said earlier: they still have games 5 and 7 at home, so youêd think theyêll be able to play much better in those games. Notable Performances The Good: Jean-Gabriel Pageau He seemed like the only skater that cared. He finished his checks, had a few chances, and he was a lot more noticeable than any other forwards on the team. Pageau has easily been the Senators best forward this series. The Bad: Almost Everyone Else I donêt want to single everyone out, because most players were equally bad. For example though, Craig Anderson wasnêt horrendous, but he has to stop that third goal. Mark Stone has to bury his chances, and has to stop turning the puck over. Alex Burrows needs to be visible on the ice. The rest of the top-six needs to wake up and not expect Pageau to score every goal. I could go on and on, as it was not pretty.   ",Blue Shirt Banter,"Rangers Dominate Game 4, Tie Series At 2-2","After thoroughly dominating the Senators in Game 3, the New York Rangers followed it up with another monstrous performance on home ice. Much like in Game 3, the Rangers completely carved up the Senators 1-3-1 trap, and made easy work of them in the offensive zone. With two straight games of dominating hockey, it appears that the Rangers have found a way to break the Senators, and Ottawa has no idea what to do when their structure is broken. As a result, Henrik Lundqvist has had a relatively easy ride these past two games with the Senators barely getting anything done in the offensive zone. With the Rangers needing another quick start on home ice, they jumped on the Senators right from the opening faceoff. It took them some time to get going, but when they did, they never looked back. After a handful of early chances, Nick Holden finally buried one at the 14:04 mark and gave the Rangers the 1-0 lead. Kevin Hayes started the entire play with a ridiculous saucer pass over to Holden, who flipped the puck over Andersonês left pad just outside of the crease. The Rangers rode that momentum gained from the first goal, and eventually translated it into a 2-0 lead. Oscar Lindberg picked up his first goal of the night after breaking in 2-on-0 with Michael Grabner, following a big shot by Tanner Glass in the defensive zone. Anderson had no chance once the puck slid over to Lindberg, and the Rangers put the Senators in a 2-0 hole. Lindberg wouldnêt stop there, though, and netted his second of the night nearing the end of the period on a bit of a fluky shot. Lindbergês shot from just inside the blue line appeared to handcuff Anderson as it came in on net, and the puck sailed over his shoulder for the 3-0 lead. With the Senators completely out of sync heading into the third period, Chris Kreider added another insurance marker on the power play to give the Rangers a commanding four goal lead.  Kyle Turris finally snapped Lundqvistês shutout streak with less than seven minutes left in regulation, and then the Senators decided to make the game a circus. With the game well out of reach, Ottawa elected to goon in up in an attempt to intimidate the Rangers heading into Game 5. It didnêt work in the slightest bit as the Rangers responded right back with the nonsense that Ottawa was tossing there way. After Ottawa finally finished their circus act, the Rangers were able to close out the final 25 seconds or so left, and secured the 4-1 win. These last two games were extremely encouraging for the Rangers, which sets the stage perfectly for Game 5 in Ottawa.  "

Turris scored 6:28 into overtime to lift the Senators to 5-4 victory over the New York Rangers on Saturday for a 3-2 series lead in their second-round series. Derick Brassard tied the score with 1:26 left in the third period for Ottawa, which trailed 2-0 just 5 1/2 minutes into the game and 4-3 with 7:12 remaining. ""We've talked about not sabotaging ourselves and we were on our way to do that again,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said of the early deficit. Mark Stone, Mike Hoffman and Tom Pyatt also scored and Craig Andersonstopped 29 shots to help Ottawa get its fifth overtime win of the postseason, including a double-overtime victory here against the Rangers in Game 2. Erik Karlsson had three assists. Jesper Fast, Nick Holden, Ryan McDonagh and Jimmy Vesey scored for the Rangers, and Henrik Lundqvist finished with 32 saves. Michael Grabner appeared to win it for the Rangers less than 5 minutes into overtime, but it was disallowed because his redirection came on a high-stick. Turris then knocked in the rebound of his own shot through Lundqvist's five-hole to put the Senators one win away from returning to the conference finals for the first time since 2007. Game 6 is Tuesday night in New York. Ottawa erased its early deficit, pulling within one late in the first and scoring 33 seconds apart in the second to take a 3-2 lead on Pyatt's goal at 8:50. ""You have to have that belief. You're not going to score the first goal every game. It's not going to always go your way,"" Pyatt said. McDonagh tied it for the Rangers late in the second and Vesey gave them the lead in the third. Brassard said the message on the Ottawa bench was""pretty clear"" at that point: Seven minutes remained to tie the game. ""Everything was positive,"" Brassard said. ""It was just, `Keep pushing! Keep pushing!""' With Anderson pulled for an extra skater, Brassard - who jumped on the ice when the goalie came to the bench - batted the rebound of Clarke MacArthur's shot with the puck deflecting in off the back of Rangers defenseman Brandon smith 's right skate. ""There is definitely an area as far as structure-wise that I thought we had addressed,"" Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said. ""Maybe the guys didn't know the goaltender was coming (out), but there was less than two minutes (to play) and (Ottawa) was down by a goal so they should expect it but maybe the guys got caught not knowing the goalie was out. "" It was exactly one week earlier that Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored twice with the goalie pulled late in regulation of Game 2 - tying it 5-5 with 1:02 remaining to tie it 5-5 - and then won it in the second overtime with his fourth goal of the game. Boucher said his philosophy in 6-on-5 situations is simple:""Score. """"In the end we know that you need presence at the net,"" Boucher said. ""The two goals are pretty similar in the sense that we had guys there and the puck went in. "" Teams that win Game 5 when a series is tied 2-2 have gone on to win 78.7 per cent of the time, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, including a perfect 3-0 in 2017. The Rangers, who trailed for only 4:11 in the first four games of the series, then grabbed hold of another lead with two goals in 66 seconds. Fast got the first one by finishing off an odd-man rush and Holden added the second on a weak shot that beat anderson 's glove far-side. New York has scored first all five games this series. Ottawa pulled to 2-1 just 50 seconds after Holden's goal as Lundqvist stopped the first attempt by Chris Wideman, but couldn't get in front of stone 's backhand rebound shot, which just crept across the goal line. The Senators tied at 8:17 of the second on two fine feeds from Karlsson and MacArthur, the latter a fake shot sent cross-ice to Hoffman who buried the shot past Lundqvist. Pyatt gave Ottawa its first lead when he redirected Zack smith 's no-look shot on goal from near the sideboards. Momentum, though, started to shift back in New York's favor in the back half of the second. Oscar Lindberg first hit a post as the Rangers spent shift after shift in Ottawa's zone. The Rangers' relentless pressure forced some sloppy puck play from the Sens, eventually leading to McDonagh's tying goal. Vesey pulled the Rangers in front 4-3 with his first career playoff goal when he pounced on a rebound of Brady Skjei's shot. Anderson looked to have pulled it back with his glove, but video review confirmed that the puck crossed the line. ""I thought we showed some good resilience and getting the go-ahead goal with about 7 minutes left,"" Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi said. ""It's too bad we couldn't hold it. Giving up the tying goal again with a minute left is tough to swallow. We have a couple days off now and then back to work. ""  ",Colin4000,"Turris scores in OT, Sens take 3-2 lead","After dropping games three and four both by a score of 4-1, the Sens retreated from New York back home for game five. With a 3-2 series lead on the line, todayês afternoon game was tense, high paced and very emotional. You know, the usual. The Sensê offence came together re-energized, and propelled the Sens to a 5-4 overtime win over the New York Rangers. Mark Tuesday evening off your calendar, as the Sens could potentially defeat the Rangers to go to the third round of the playoffs for the first time since 2007! With the way game four ended, and with Chris Neil drawing into the lineup for Ryan Dzingel, we couldnêt have expected anything different than todayês physical start. Big chances were exchanged at both ends, with scrums ensuing after the whistle. It didnêt take long to break the ice, however, as Jesper Fast netted his third goal of the playoffs to give New York the early lead. Chris Wideman was caught pinching along the boards, and couldnêt catch up to the fast Fast who was wide open for the one-timer. Just over a minute later, the Rangers would double their lead, as Ottawa turned the puck over to Nick Holden who sent a shot over the shoulder of Craig Anderson. It was a bit of a rough start for Andy, allowing two early after being pulled for Mike Condon just two days earlier. It was looking dire for the Sens only five minutes in, although hope was re-instilled 50 seconds later, with Mark Stone putting the Sens on the board. Henrik Lundqvist played the puck along the boards, which caused a turnover. Chris Wideman took a shot from the point, which rebounded off Lundqvist and onto the stick of a battling Stone. The puck slid in, giving this game itês third goal within a span of 1:56. The Sensê power play seemed reinvigorated today, throwing as many pucks as possible towards the net. It didnêt produce any goals, going 0-for-3, but whatever was happening while in New York seemed to be rid of. Ottawa continued their momentum into the end of the second period, getting a few close chances to tie it up. Lundqvist made some incredible stops, though, including this robbery: In the second period, Tanner Glass took an interference call on Dion Phaneuf, sending Ottawa to the power play. Chris Neil took objection, however, tossing his fists at Glass, picking up 10-minute misconduct as well as a roughing penalty to negate the call on Glass. Guy Boucher obviously didnêt take that into appreciation, playing Neil a total of 2:25 by the end of regulation, including zero minutes in the third period. The play would settle down for a bit, until Ottawa would erase the Rangersê lead off a goal from Mike Hoffman. Erik Karlsson made a dash through the neutral zone, feeding a pass to Clarke MacArthur on his right. MacArthur sent the puck to Mike Hoffman on his right, who shot the puck over a sprawling Lundqvist who couldnêt get over in time.  Ottawa wasnêt done yet, though. With all three first period goals coming in quick succession, Ottawa continued the trend, taking the lead 33 seconds after making the game a tie. Zack Smith would spin and put the puck towards the net, which would be tipped by Tom Pyatt. The puck would squeak through Lundqvistês five hole and into the back of the net, something you wonêt see very often. After being on their heels early, the Sens found themselves up 3-2. New York responded with urgency, however, bringing the game back to even after a long stretch of pouring on the offensive pressure. Ryan McDonagh would get credit with the tipped goal, although it was Michael Grabner who would send the shot in. Grabnerês been a dangerous player against the Sens this series, now on a four game point streak (2-2-4 in that span).  The third frame saw both teams playing evenly matched, although at a slower pace than before. 12:48 in, Cody Ceci would completely lose coverage of Jimmy Vesey, who in a scramble in front, slashed the puck towards a wide open net. It looked like a sure goal, except Craig Anderson would toss his glove out, making what appeared to be a save-of-the year candidate. What you may notice though, is that although Anderson made the catch, the puck went past the goal line. Further review concluded that it was a good goal for New York, once again putting the Sens in a hole with limited time remaining. With less than two minutes left, in desperation, Craig Anderson would head to the bench, trying as hard as possible to prevent New York from being able to close out the series at home.  Net empty, Derick Brassard would rush off the bench towards the net. The puck bounced off his leg, off the skate of Brendan Smith, and past the goal line to even this game at 4-4. The Canadian Tire Centre was electrified, witnessing Brassard score against his former team in the most crucial moment. Overtime would be needed. In the extra frame, Ottawa would dominate, allowing only one shot attempt the entire OT. That one attempt would be quite the scare, though, as Grabner batted a flying puck out of the air which beat Anderson over his shoulder. The referee called no goal, which was confirmed after review due to a high stick.  That wouldnêt phase the Sens, however, who continued to fire on all cylinders. Around the six minute mark, Karlsson made a beautiful stretch pass up the ice, and we all know how those turn out. Burrows fed a pass to Kyle Turris, who fired a shot which was blocked by Dan Girardi. Turris picked the puck back up, danced his way past Girardi and slid the puck through Lundqvistês five hole for the game winning goal. With his third career overtime winner in the playoffs, Turris surpassed Daniel Alfredsson for the most in Sens history, including this oneagainst the Rangers in 2012. It was an incredible showing from the entire team, earning a 3-2 series lead with a chance to go to close it out on Tuesday. Notable Performances What would a Sens win be without Erik Karlsson turning in a stellar performance? He picked up three assists on the afternoon, and showed once again why heês one of the best players in the world. Although he had a shaky start, Craig Anderson made some key saves late to keep the Sens in it. His positioning at times looked questionable, though, so hopefully he can build on today for a solid game six. At the other end, Henrik Lundqvist returned to his game two form, allowing a couple questionable goals that he wouldêve saved in either of the last two games. Chris Neilês insertion into the lineup was called into question by many entering today, and it didnêt pay off. If it was Boucherês plan all along to only play him for only 2:25, why not just play Dzingel? Jean-Gabriel Pageau continued to be the Sensê best forward this game, leading the team in CF%. Game-tying hero Derick Brassard led both teams with five shots on goal. Zibanejad came close with four. It was an up and down game for Chris Wideman, who although had some defensive lapses, also did his part in contributing in the offensive zone. He was noticeable tonight, both in the good and bad sense. On the other hand, his partner, Fredrik Claesson, looked fantastic in his first game back from being scratched. His defensive positioning was exceptional, and he used his booming shot to his advantage. Somehow leading the Rangers in Corsi percentage, Tanner Glass continued to get under the Sensê skin all game. Finally, Kyle Turris was dangerous in a few ways, scoring the OT winner and also leading both teams tonight with nine hits.   ",Blue Shirt Banter,"Rangers Blow Late Lead, Fall To Senators In Overtime","Sounds familiar, doesnêt it? For the second time this series, and third time in the playoffs overall, the New York Rangers failed to close out a game while leading in the closing minutes. You would think that after going on this adventure twice already, Alain Vigneault would learn his lesson. Clearly not. AVês personnel usage has been questioned countless times since the playoffs began, and at this point, itês just exhausting.  Thereês nothing left to be said than whatês out there already, but yet, Vigneault continues to fall back on his ways. Itês almost like heês doing it on purpose at this point, because there is simply zero explanation for it. Itês extremely frustrating, because the Rangers have clearly been the better team in this series, theyêre just continually shooting themselves in the foot at the worst possible times. Credit to Ottawa though, as theyêve found a way to hang around in the series, and are exposing the Rangers when the wheels fall off like they did again this afternoon. Funny enough, this game perfectly summed up how much of a roller coaster ride this series has truly been. Gameês 1 and 2 were as bad as the Rangers have played this series, and Gameês 3 and 4 were about as dominating as theyêve been in quite a while. We got a little of both in this game, as the Rangers came storming out of the gates with a pair goals in the first five minutes of regulation. Then, they followed it up by allowing three straight goals to give the Senators some life. For whatever reason, the Rangers just donêt seem to have that killer instinct when they have an opportunity to bury a team. But once their backs are against the wall, they decide to play like the team they are capable of being. We saw that once again following the Senatorsê trio of goals, as Ryan McDonagh and Jimmy Vesey scored to give the Rangers a 4-3 lead with about seven minutes remaining. Unfortunately, the Rangers fell back into their usual shell after gaining the lead, and it came back to haunt them.....again. Derick Brassard wound up tying the game on a bit of a fortunate bounce, after the puck deflected off of several players and rolled past Henrik Lundqvist. Much like the previous two times, the Rangers appeared completely stunned when the puck dropped in overtime. They barely even sniffed the offensive zone aside from one or two chances and just looked completely dead in the water. On one of their few chances in overtime, Michael Grabner appeared to end the game but the goal was immediately waved off because of a high stick. Shortly after that, Kyle Turris would end the game following a blocked shot, and slipped the puck past Lundqvist to give the Senators a 3-2 series lead.  Obviously the series isnêt over just yet, and like I mentioned earlier, the Rangers often play their best hockey when theyêre close to falling off of the cliff. It truly does suck that inept personnel decisions have put them in a 3-2 series hole, but thereês still two games left to get this done. Game 6 is scheduled for Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, so weêll see then which Rangers team decides to show up.  "

The New York Rangers pushed and pushed, but the resilient Senators held on - all the way to their first Eastern Conference final in 10 years. Karlsson had a goal and an assist, Craig Anderson made 37 saves and the Senators eliminated the Rangers with a 4-2 victory in Game 6 of their second-round series Tuesday night. ""We knew they were going to come back with a real good push,"" Senators forward Kyle Turris said. ""We knew it was going to be probably the hardest period of the playoffs for us so far. It was and we just tried to weather the storm. "" Trailing 3-1 after two periods, New York pulled within one on Chris Kreider's goal 53 seconds into the third. The Rangers outshot the Senators 15-5 in the final period, but couldn't find the equalizer. Jean-Gabriel Pageau clinched the series for Ottawa with an empty-netter with 6.2 seconds left for his seventh goal of the postseason. ""They had chances and a lot of them,"" forward Mark Stone said. ""That was the time when we needed our goaltender to be big. "" Stone and Mike Hoffman scored in the first period for Ottawa, and Clarke MacArthur finished with two assists. The Senators, headed to the conference finals for the first time since their run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2007, will face Pittsburgh or Washington in the next round. Their series is headed to Game 7 on Wednesday night. Mika Zibanejad also scored for New York, and Henrik Lundqvist had 22 saves. ""We had a lot of chances that I think we let slip through our fingers,"" Rangers center Derek Stepan said,""but it's a good team over there. Don't sell them short. They battled real hard, they played real strong games, and they had that magic. Sometimes you've got to have a little bit of that. "" Kreider had a chance to tie it a little over 5 minutes into the third, but didn't get a clean shot on a pass from Zibanejad. His attempt from in front trickled off his stick and was stopped by Anderson. Lundqvist made some stellar saves late in the third, including a stop on Derick Brassard from the right side with 5 minutes left. ""Right now all you feel is disappointment and it's a numb feeling,"" Lundqvist said. ""It's not a great feeling. You realize how much work and how many hours you put into this to put yourself in this spot to get this chance. "" Zibanejad got the Rangers on the scoreboard with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the second. He took a pass from Mats Zuccarello, skated in and beat Anderson on the glove side into the top right corner. Karlsson then beat Lundqvist on the blocker side with 4:07 remaining to restore the Senators' two-goal lead. The Rangers outshot the Senators 13-10 in the first, but trailed 2-0 after 20 minutes. New York had three power plays and more scoring chances, but Ottawa was aggressive on defense while blocking nine shots in the opening period, and whatever got past the defense was stopped by Anderson. ""It elevates your game knowing that these guys are battling and they are paying the price,"" Anderson said of his teammates blocking shots. ""Everyone works a little harder for each other when guys do that type of play. "" Hoffman put Ottawa in front 4:27 into the game. He got the puck behind the net and sent a pass out to MacArthur. He then went in front of the net and deflected a shot from Karlsson past Lundqvist for his fourth of the playoffs. It came on the Senators' second shot on goal of the game and marked the first time Ottawa scored first in the series. Stone scored with 5:16 left in the first when he got a pass from MacArthur on the left side as he crossed the blue line, skated up and fired a shot past Lundqvist for his fourth of postseason. Rangers coach Alain Vigneault challenged the play for offside, but the goal stood after a review. NOTES: The NHL announced the Rangers will face the Buffalo Sabres in the Winter Classic at Citi Field, home of baseball's New York Mets. Commissioner Gary Bettman made the announcement on television during the first intermission. ... The Senators were 0 for 2 on the power play, finishing the series 1 for 18 and falling to 6 for 41 in the postseason. ... The Rangers were 0 for 4 with the man advantage. They finished 2 for 24 in the series and 3 for 39 in the playoffs.  ",Colin4000,"Sens close out Rangers, win 4-2","Eight down, eight to go! Tonightês matchup between the Ottawa Senators and New York Rangers came with high stakes. Win, and the Senators move on to the final four. Lose, and the Rangers push a game seven heading back to Ottawa. The Sens came out blazing, taking the game by a score of 4-2, closing out the New York Rangers in six games. The Senators took control early, with Mike Hoffman putting the team up 1-0 five minutes in. Erik Karlsson took the shot from the point, with the tip by Hoffman fooling Henrik Lundqvistand putting a hush to an ecstatic Madison Square Garden.  A big part of tonightês win was the Sensê penalty kill, fighting off three Rangers power plays, including a double minor high-sticking call on Derick Brassard midway through the first. The Rangers were getting shots off, although would most be held to the outside and with minimal lead-up movement. Maybe it was just a dead power play from the Rangers, although the Sens held their ground. Ottawa extended their lead to 2-0 later in the frame, with Mark Stone pulling the trigger on Lundqvistês short side. It was a perfect shot, although this goal is also a demonstration of Stoneês incredible mind. If you watch the replay below, you can see Stone look directly at MacArthur, as if heês going to make a pass. The look, as well as the way the puck is positioned on the blade of his stick, completely fools Lundqvist who makes a small gesture anticipating a pass. Stone shoots instead, and Lundqvist, knowing heês been deceived, can only look to the sky in exasperation. The goal was reviewed for offside, and it looked impossibly close to tell given the frame rate of the replay. I thought for sure it would be inconclusive (which wouldêve still resulted in a goal), although the referee announced it as being confirmed onside.  Period one ended 2-0, forty minutes away from the Eastern Conference Finals. The second period was mostly back and forth, with the halfway mark still remaining a two-goal game. If this series has taught us anything, though, itês that no lead is ever safe. The Rangers would strike next, by the player we were all fearing would score eventually: Mika Zibanejad. Completely left off the radar of Phaneuf and Ceci, Z-Bad was sent in on a breakaway that resulted in a goal.  With the Rangers desperately trying to push the game to a tie, the pace would pick up significantly from that point on for both teams. Bobby Ryan led a rush into the offensive zone and went behind the net, feeding a pass to a pinching Erik Karlsson. Left uncovered by Brady Skjei, the captain made no mistake, regaining the two goal lead.  Period two ended 3-1, twenty minutes away from the Eastern Conference Finals! No win has come easy for the Senators these playoffs, and todayês match took no exception. Score effects kicked in big time, as the Sens began to sit back on their lead. 53 seconds in, Chris Kreider would pick up a bouncing puck, and with Cody Ceci completely lost, he would bust in on a breakaway. The fast goal gave life to the Rangers, who became even more desperate to tie it. Shot attempts in the third period were 17-5 in New Yorkês favour, although Craig Andersonwould play the hero for the remainder of the game. He made crucial stop after crucial stop, leading to Lundqvist being pulled in the final minute and a half. The Rangers would crank up the fire hose as much as they could, although a simple neutral zone turnover put the dagger in, with none other than Jean-Gabriel Pageau scoring goal number six of this series.  The clock ticked down, the goal horn sounded, and both teams lined up for handshakes. Period three ended 4-2, with the Ottawa Senators heading to the Eastern Conference Finals!!!!! Notable Performances Erik Karlsson earned first-star honours this game, picking up the winning goal as well as the assist to Hoffman. He did much much more than just that though, with hockey fans from all over the world fawning over Karlssonês play.  Craig Anderson also stood on his head tonight, bailing out a porous defence that allowed 39 shots against. This was the #BeastMode weêve been looking for. Looking rejuvenated tonight was Mark Stone, whose celebration after his goal confirmation was priceless. Two point night for Stoner. Clarke MacArthur picked up a couple points tonight as well, both assists, and served as a key component to the offensive unit. Despite taking the loss, Henrik Lundqvist played a key part in keeping this game close. Rick Nash also picked up six shots on goal tonight, the most of either team. I mentioned the defence was noticeably porous tonight, and Cody Ceci was the biggest part of that, losing coverage numerous times on the Rangersê forwards. If you didnêt think Chris Neil could play less than his 2:26 in game five, you were wrong. Neilês (lack of) deployment once again remained a mystery, being brought down to a total 1:49 on the evening. Make what you will of it, but his contribution on the ice tonight was basically zero.  ",Blue Shirt Banter,Rangersê Season Ends Following 4-2 Loss In Game 6,"Well, here we are once again. Another season that ended far too early, and another season that ended in heartbreak for Henrik Lundqvist. In a do or die Game 6, the New York Rangers just didnêt seem ready when the puck dropped. Like much of this series, the Rangers completely shot themselves in the foot with their slow start, and the Ottawa Senators made them pay big time. Mike Hoffman immediately made this a 1-0 game at the 4:27 mark after deflecting home Erik Karlssonês point shot. With the Senators continually pressuring, they eventually doubled up their lead nearing the end of the first period. Mark Stone was the recipient of the second goal following a 2-on-2 rush into the Rangers zone.  Brendan Smith gave Stone way too much room as he entered the zone, and Stone absolutely bombed a wrist shot past Lundqvist on the short side. The Garden went dead quiet following the second goal, and it was fairly evident the Rangers were trying to fight through the frustration. Finally, after going almost a period and a half without a goal, the Rangers finally caught the break they were looking for. Mika Zibanejad flew right up the middle of the ice, around the Senators defensemen, and lofted the puck over Craig Anderson. Zibanejadês goal gave the MSG crowd some life, and more importantly, the Rangers look poised to turn the momentum back in their favor. However, the Senators almost immediately crushed that hope as Erik Karlsson snapped home what appeared to be a backbreaking goal. Trailing 3-1 heading into the third period, the Rangers had 20 minutes to muster up some sort of comeback if they planned on surviving until Thursday. Chris Kreider restored that hope once again just a minute into the third, after a ridiculous power move to the net. That goal gave the Rangers life once again, and this time they kept the momentum for a majority of the third period. With the ice completely tilted in the Senators end, the Rangers continued to to test Craig Anderson but they just couldnêt find a way to break him. The Rangers had a massive opportunity late in the game with the Senators getting caught with too many men on the ice. Unfortunately, the Rangers kept a majority of their chances to the perimeter which made life very easy on Anderson. Jean-Gabriel Pageau eventually iced the game and the series with under 10 seconds remaining as he tallied the empty net goal. With this loss, the Rangers will now turn their attention to the offseason where there will hopefully be wholesale changes on the backend.  "
13,2 Playoffs,5/13/2017,7:00 PM,A,Pittsburgh Penguins,2,1,W,OT,9,4,,W 3,35,8,0,2,0,28,4,0,5,0,"18,614",2:56,Bobby Ryan lifts Senators past Penguins in OT in Game 1,"By his own estimate, it took Ottawa's Bobby Ryan a full 82 games to adjust to first-year coach Guy boucher 's system. Consider the forward all caught up. The rest of the consistently surprising Senators, too. Ryan broke in alone on Marc-Andre Fleury and deked the Pittsburgh goalie before flipping a backhand into the open net 4:59 into overtime to give Ottawa a 2-1 victory Saturday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. ""I knew at some point those pucks I'd been chasing all year long, they were going to come,"" Ryan said after picking up his fifth goal of the playoffs. ""You just want to redeem yourself. You let your teammates down (during the regular season). Now I'm getting to redeem myself a little bit. That's all I'm trying to do. "" The Senators improved to 6-1 when pushed beyond regulation during the postseason to give them early control of the best-of-seven series against the defending Stanley Cup champions, a matchup few outside of the guys in the red, white and black jerseys gave them a shot of winning. Not that it seems to bother Ottawa. One game in and the Senators have already done to the Penguins what Washington and Columbus could not: grab control of the series. ""There's a lot of things to like but it's just one game,"" Boucher said. ""We won't get too excited. "" Boucher hasn't backed away from the underdog role. If anything, he's embraced it. A year ago the Senators missed the playoffs while the Penguins sprinted to the franchise's Cup. Now Ottawa finds itself on equal footing and hardly appeared intimidated by the stage. Ryan assisted on Jean-Gabriel pageau 's first-period goal, Craig Anderson made 27 saves and the Senators turned away five Pittsburgh power plays. Evgeni Malkin's goal late in the third period forced the extra period, but Pittsburgh struggled to generate any consistent pressure on Anderson. The problem wasn't Ottawa's neutral zone trap designed to slow teams down but a decided lack of aggression once Malkin, captain Sidney Crosby and company crossed the Senators' blue line. ""We're looking for that next play instead of putting pucks at the net,"" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. The Penguins only managed 17 shots in five-on-five situations, compared to 32 by Ottawa. Pittsburgh also gave it away 17 times, two of which led to goals. ""We understand, they wait,"" Malkin said. ""They need one chance, two-on-one or three-on-two to score. "" The Penguins only had 72 hours to recharge following a draining seven-game series against Washington. While Pittsburgh insisted it would have no problem hitting reset with a spot in the Stanley Cup finals on the line, there was a dip in intensity both on the ice and in the stands. For long stretches, it felt like the game could have been played in mid-December instead of mid-May, which was just fine by Ottawa. The Penguins didn't lack for opportunities to jump on the Senators but four first-period power plays - including 45 seconds of a 5-on-3 - went nowhere. Ron Hainsey hit the crossbar early and Patric Hornqvist dinged the left post but that's as close as Pittsburgh would get to slipping one by Anderson. ""There were some good looks there,"" said Crosby, who had just two shots in 23:32 of ice time. ""They're not going to give you anything but we worked hard to get our chances and we've got to bury them when we get them. "" The Senators focused not on creating extended pressure on Fleury but instead taking advantage of Pittsburgh's mistakes. The breakthrough came 14:32 into the first when Penguins defenseman Brian Dumoulin left a blind drop pass behind his net that Ryan intercepted and slipped to Pageau in the right circle. The puck zipped over Fleury's glove and suddenly Ottawa had the lead. It appeared it would be enough to put Pittsburgh away in regulation until Malkin redirected a Chris Kunitz shot between anderson 's legs with 5:35 left in the third. No matter. The Senators did what they've done repeatedly during their surprising run to the NHL's final four: they found a way. ""Our players are really good at not fearing the outcome, and we play the way we play,"" Boucher said. ""Whether it's overtime or third period or we're leading or we're trailing. We just really keep the same approach. So it's been healthy for us. "" NOTES: Malkin moved past Jaromir Jagr and into third-place on Pittsburgh's career playoff scoring list with 148 points. ... Ottawa's Alexandre Burrows poked the puck out of Fleury's glove and into the net just past the midway point but the referees had blown the play dead. The call was upheld upon review. ... pageau 's eight goals are the second-most by a Senators player during a single postseason. Daniel Alfredsson scored 14 while leading Ottawa to the Cup finals in 2007. ... Fleury finished with 33 saves.  ",Ross A,Bobby Ryanês OT goal seals Game 1,"Well, that felt great. Thereês no other way to put it. Watching the Ottawa Senators win Game 1 over the Pittsburgh Penguins was fantastic. The fact that the Sens held their own was great too. The first period started off a little tense. The Pens hit the post twice before the period was very old. The Sens also took four penalties in the period compared to the Pensê zero, including 45 seconds of 5-on-3 kill, but the Sensê PK was strong. The lone goal of the first period though went to Jean-Gabriel Pageau, who snapped it home short-side on a nifty no-look behind-the-net pass from Bobby Ryan. The Sens managed to survive four PKs and take the lead, making it overall a great road period. The second period I expected to see some makeup calls. Ottawa actually drew a penalty while shorthanded early in the period, negating the remnant of Pittsburghês powerplay. However, that would do it for the makeup calls, with Mark Stone getting the only other penalty of the period. It wouldnêt matter though, because both goalies were strong. Craig Anderson in particular made some impressive stops. When Andy Ice is in the zone, he is near unbeatable. Alexandre Burrows actually put the puck in the net, but the whistle had blown, and besides Marc-Andre Fleuryês glove was on the puck before Burrows forced the puck out into the net, so the goal wouldnêt count. The third period was great for Ottawa. Despite having the lead for most of the period, they actually dominated the shot clock 14-7. Thatês #TheSystem at play my friends. Ottawa drew an early powerplay, but almost managed to wreck things by giving up a great shorthanded chance (as per usual). Ottawa played some decent shutdown hockey, but it wasnêt quite enough. Bobby Ryan took a hard cross-check to the head from behind and stayed down a little while, but he managed to shake it off and come back to play in the game. Just when you thought the team might squeak out the 1-0 win, Evgeni Malkin got a fluky tip through Andersonês five-hole and into the net with five-and-a-half minutes remaining. Ottawa would then pour on the pressure, but Pittsburgh came closest with Chris Kunitz hitting the crossbar. In the end, the team went to OT, meaning Sens fans would once again have to watch some high-stress, winners-take-all hockey. Overtime was mostly Ottawaês period. Pittsburgh got a few seconds in the Sensê zone, but to me it didnêt look like much pressure. And off a Pageau faceoff win, Erik Karlsson fired the puck up the zone, Ryan chipped it around the high defenceman and raced in on a pseudo-breakaway. He made a quick move and beat Fleury on a backhand to the high far corner, a great move from a suddenly great goal-scorer. Sens win, 2-1. Sens lead the series 1-0. Notable Performances: Craig Anderson: he was focused tonight, tracking every deflection, every bounce, every shot. Without him in goal, this couldêve been a very different game. Jean-Gabriel Pageau: he finished with two points, five shots, and one monstrous hit. He just seemed full of energy tonight, and it was nice to see him rewarded with some big points. Bobby Ryan: that goal was the thing dreams are made of. What hustle, what a finishing move. That assist on the first goal was also beautiful. Evgeni Malkin: by far Pittsburghês best player tonight. He was clearly on a mission. The Sens better find a way to cool him down for Game 2. Tonight the Sens served notice that they are in this series to play. They actually deserve to be playing among the best in the Eastern Conference. Bring on the rest of the series.  ",Pensburgh,Bobby ryan 's OT goal gives Ottawa win,"Pregame The Penguins roll with the same lines and personnel from the last game.  1st period The Senators take 4 penalties but fail to cash in and look pretty poor despite all the chances. Ottawa scores the game's first goal when Brian Dumoulin makes an ill-advised drop and Bobby Ryan intercepts and then throws a beautiful pass to Jean-Gabriel Pageau who beats Marc-Andre Fleury. Despite that, Pittsburgh pretty much carried the play for much of the period, though all those power plays certainly influenced it too. Shots on goal 8-6 for the Pens and this finally looks like a series where they can and will impose some possession on their opponent. 2nd period More of the same, the Pens push but Craig Anderson makes a ton of saves. The Senators score again but the refs take it back, ruled to have whistled the play dead just before. Seems like about the first break Pittsburgh has caught. Shots are 19-18 overall for Pittsburgh after 2 periods. 3rd period Ottawa plays well in the 3rd, even getting the majority of the shots early. The Pens put a small push on but don't do too much Finally, the Pens score. Evgeni Malkin had a quiet night up to this point but he gets a nice redirect on a Chris Kunitz shot and it just sneaks under the pads of Anderson to tie it at 1. After Fleury makes a nice save, Kessel hits the cross-bar. Overtime The Senators knock a puck past Justin Schultz and Bryan Rust in the Pens offensive zone and Bobby Ryan is off to the races, zooming past Olli Maatta then lifts a backhand shot over Fleury to give Ottawa Game 1. Some Thoughts A lot of folks pointing out, accurately so, that this game was a lot like G1 of the 2016 ECF against Tampa. Pittsburgh controlled play for the most of both games and got a ton of power play time but couldn't make the most of it. And they played quality goaltending and the Pens lost. Hopefully that script changes for Game 2. Tough to go 0 for 5 on the PP (with significant 5v3 time) and expect to win. Ottawa is now 6-1 these playoffs in overtime games. They're clearly comfortable and used to playing tight games and finding the rabbit to pull out of their hat. Worked on this night, NBC's Ed Olczyk said the OT winner was their first odd-man rush of the night. Made it count. I'm sure a hangover from last round narrative will start soon if it already hasn't, but no so certain that was necessarily the case. True, the Pens were sloppy. Also true, not a very complete effort all night long. Seemed more a case of not hitting paydirt on all those early PP's and thrown out of sync. Time will tell, Game 2 is Monday night. Hopefully by then Pittsburgh is able to adjust and take the play more to Ottawa.  "

"" If his players have something to say, Sullivan wants them to get it out. Enter Phil Kessel, the mercurial forward with the blistering shot and occasionally blistering tongue. Frustrated by an inability to get anything by Ottawa's Craig Anderson, cameras caught Kessel pounding his fists and ordering his teammates to look for him. Consider the message delivered. Kessel took a feed from Evgeni Malkin and zipped a wrist shot by Anderson 13:05 into the third period as the Penguins evened the Eastern Conference final with a 1-0 victory in Game 2 on Monday night. Game 3 is Wednesday in Ottawa. ""To be honest I think I yelled more than once tonight, so I don't remember that time,"" Kessel said with a laugh. That's just Kessel being Kessel. If anything, his outburst was simply the physical manifestation of Sullivan's order to stop looking for the perfect shot and just start peppering Anderson looking for a sliver of space. The moment came with just less than 7 minutes remaining when Malkin gained the zone and found Kessel in the slot. Kessel's first shot smacked off Jean Gabriel Pagueau and came right back to him. It happened so quickly Anderson didn't have enough time to reset, his left pad flailing as Pittsburgh's game-long domination finally resulted in something tangible: a lead and a tie series. ""I caught an edge, simple as that,"" said Anderson, who finished with 28 saves. ""A defenseman or forward catches an edge, he falls down, nothing happens. I catch an edge, it's in the net. "" That was enough for Marc-Andre Fleury, who stopped 23 shots for his second shutout of the playoffs and 10th of his postseason career. Fleury's 62nd playoff win moved him ahead of Henrik Lundqvist for the most by an active goaltender, heady territory for a guy who lost his starting job to Matt Murray during the course of the season. Now Fleury is the main reason the Penguins are three wins from a return trip to the Cup finals. This victory, however, wasn't the byproduct of 60 minutes of brilliance. Fleury spent long stretches with nothing to do as the Penguins hemmed Ottawa in its own end. The Senators went nearly 19 minutes between the second and third period without recording a single shot, a testament to Pittsburgh's ability to play keepaway on the other end of the ice. ""We were pleased with the way we dictated the terms out there,"" Sullivan said. A marked departure from Game 1, as Pittsburgh struggled to generate any sort of extended pressure in a 2-1 overtime loss. The Stanley Cup champions responded by heavily tilting the ice at times, remarkable considering they spent most of the night down two men after forward Bryan Rust and defenseman Justin Schultz left in the first period with injuries. Rust was on the losing end of a clean check by Ottawa's Dion Phaneuf 4:58 into the game. Schultz, who has become Pittsburgh's most important blue liner with Kris Letang and Trevor Daley out, slid awkwardly into the end boards after getting bumped off the puck by Senators forward Mike Hoffmanabout midway through the first. Sullivan offered no updates on either player. Somehow, the Penguins found a way to make it work. The five remaining defensemen all played at least 20 minutes, including 24:49 from 37-year-old Ron Hainsey, who is in the playoffs for the first time in his career. ""After a while the rotation is kind of set and away you go,"" Hainsey said. ""You don't have time to really mentally think about any mistakes good or bad, because you're going right back out there. You don't have any other choice. "" Pittsburgh's ability to hog the puck hardly seemed to bother the Senators, who have proven repeatedly during their deepest playoff run in a decade they're just fine sitting back and waiting for an opening to counter. It's a style that produced both goals in Game 1. This time, it eventually caught up to them. ""The third period they stepped it up a notch and we didn't,"" Ottawa coach Guy Boucher said. ""They were surging. They were aggressive. We didn't manage it as well. "" NOTES: Malkin's assist gives him 20 points in the playoffs, tops in the NHL. ... Both teams went 0 for 1 on the power play. ... Penguins F Patric Hornqvistskated during pregame warmups but was scratched. Hornqvist has been dealing with a series of bumps and bruises incurred while blocking shots during the opening two rounds of the playoffs. ... Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger made a rare appearance at PPG Paints Arena. Roethlisberger, who announced last month he's returning for a 14th season, and the rest of the Steelers begin organized team activities next week.  ",Ary M,"Sens accept the split; lose Game 2, 1-0.","Well, that was less fun.  Coming off of the heels of a well-deserved Game 1 victory, the Sens were looking to head back to Ottawa with a 2-0 series lead. And due to the final score, itês easy to rue the day because Çone shotê couldêve accomplished this goal. However, if youêd told us before the series that theyêd be going home with a 1-1 split -- I think most of us wouldêve taken it, and thatês where they are.  Period 1 started off much like Game 1, with the Sens keeping the Pens to the outside while generating more shots (10   8 in favour of the folks in white). The Pageau   Ryan connection looked sharp, while the Malkin   Kessel duo stayed as the Pens most dangerous.  The two differences   and potential hints that Game 1 was going to be a little different than Game 2? One: Sidney Crosby was generating chances, with Bryan Rust and Jake Guentzel getting two shots in tight early. Second: the physicality. Dion Phaneuf started the hit parade that persisted throughout Game 2 by knocking Rust out of the game with an open-ice hit.  Afterwards, Hoffman pushed Schultz while in on the forecheck and the Pens blueliner collided with the boards awkwardly. He also didnêt return with what looked to be a shoulder injury, reducing the already-depleted Pens to 5 blueliners for the rest of the game.  Conor Sheary responded by taking out Wideman on the forecheck, but unlike Hoffman, he was called for the penalty. Looking at this angle though [LINK], itês hard to know what the Pens faithful were booing at as there was a clear toe-pick; although Wideman landed hard, he stayed in the game. Lucky for the Penguins, the Sens powerplay extended its dry run to 7 games (0/17). The physical play and injuries seemed to motivate the Penguins, as they came out flying for period two and controlled the rest of the game (68% CF% in periods two and three). Although all four Pens lines seemed to have extended zone time in the Sens zone, Claesson/Methot - Karlsson struggled against an improved Crosby tonight. Time after time, Crosby set up Sheary and Guentzel with deft chances in the offensive zone only to have his wingers either missed the net, or were stopped by Anderson   who was excellent for the second game in a row.  The other big story was the Pens fourth line of Rowney   Cullen   Wilson generating momentum by modelling an aggressive forecheck in the offensive zone. Wilson led the Pens with 9 hits, many on the Sens D corps. I should add, though, that unlike Games 3 and 4 against the Rangers, the Sens didnêt look physically outmatched tonight. In fact, the big names on both teams (Crosby, Guentzel, Hoffman, Turris, Phaneuf) all ended up in the box at some point due to coincidental penalties from slashes, scrums, or aggressive board play. Sorry, Chris Neil fans, I donêt think youêll see him in Game 3.  The only goal of the game came from the rabid Phil Kessel, who was talking to himself all night and even got into a fight with his linemate, Evgeni Malkin, on the bench. As the Sens saw in Game 2 vs. the Bruins, teammate fights happen all the time, and sure enough, Malkin got Kessel the puck with a little bit of space high in the offensive zone and the burly winger scored on his second attempt (and first shot of the night) to put the Pens up 1   0 with 7 minutes left. After going 18:53 without a shot through the second and the third, the Sens ended up firing seven on Marc-Andre Fleury by the end of the period   with all coming in the last 4 minutes. There was some notable pressure, with Boucher putting Chris Wideman and Erik Karlsson together for a max offense pairing but the former missed the net wide on the teamês two best offensive zone looks at even-strength. After a Sens timeout for a 6-on-5 opportunity, Mike Hoffman, Kyle Turris, and JG Pageau had chances to give the Sens yet another magical moment, but fell short.  Notable Performances Pittsburgh didnêt do any damage on a second period powerplay with Erik Karlsson in the box, but had a golden opportunity after Karlsson (and two other defenders) got stuck on the ice for three consecutive icings. Tommy Wingels (!) won three faceoffs and the Sens survived, though.  Only one Penguin finished <50% in shot attempts tonight (Brian Dumoulin); only three Senators finished >50% (MacArthur, Turris, Hoffman). Yikes.  Once again, Craig Anderson was solid. He tracked the puck well, didnêt come out of his net all that often, and placed his rebounds in good spots (just like Game 1). Final shot totals were 29 - 23 Pittsburgh, and going by the heatmap below, it was one of the easiest shutouts of Marc-Andre Fleuryês playoff career.  Why couldnêt the Sens generate offence like Game 1? Iêll give the credit to Mike Sullivan, who made adjustments with the Pens forecheck to have them stay in the Sens zone longer. Donêt get fooled: the Sens still did a great job of limiting quality overall (expected goals at 1.71 for Pittsburgh), itês just that they generated squat (xGF = 0.89 for Ottawa). With the neutral zone stuff basically the same as Game 1, the Sens mainly had trouble breaking out cleanly from their own zone, and when they did, they couldnêt enter the Pens zone with control OR were too tired so they could only dump and change. Unlike Game 1, the Sens had problems with their breakouts, didnêt have their second forward in the right position, or didnêt support the puck carrier as they tried to transition from defence to offence. Look for this to change in Game 3.  ",Pensburgh,Phil Kessel's goal pushes Pens past Sens,"Pregame Patric Hornqvist doesn't practice yesterday but he takes warmup tonight at least to test things out. Must not have been ideal, as he takes a seat and Carl Hagelin returns to get back in the lineup. 1st period Bryan Rust keeps his head down cutting through the middle, and though hockey is a safer space nowadays, you just can't do that. Dion Phaneuf drills him. Yeah, he lifts off, but that's basically any hit. Yeah, he probably hits his head, but what else is there to hit with a guy exposing himself so bad? Nothing really to wrong with this hit in a contact sport, if this is Orpik on Semin in 2009, Penguins fans LOVE it. But it's not, so most hate it. So it goes. Since Penguins injuries seemingly always come in bunches, Justin Schultz would also have to leave the game after going arm/shoulder first in a fairly routine looking play gone wrong. Neither Rust nor Schultz would return in the game, leaving Pittsburgh with 11F and 5D for the majority of the game, and that's pretty much a first line forward and their most skilled defenseman too. Shots end up 10-8 Ottawa in the first, but Fenwick is 18-14 Pens so take that. 2nd period Not too much truly going on. The Pens take it to the Senators but can't quite break through their good defensive play and Craig anderson 's even better goaltending. Scott Wilson goes crazy at one point and has 4 official hits on a single shift alone. Gives the crowd at least something to notice and good for him. Jake Guentzel hits the post, then Sid feeds him right in front but he juuuust airmails the shot over the top of the net. It happens. Phil's going crazy, talking and shouting to himself and anyone who will listen. Chris Kunitz is laughing and everyone is too. Shots up to 20-16 Pens at the end of 2, Fenwick is 33-21 Pittsburgh. The game is shifted but the score remains tied. 3rd period Pittsburgh keeps knocking but Anderson keeps answering. Until.....Evgeni Malkin is a one-man zone-exit and zone-entry then centers for Phil. Kessel sticks with it and finally hits paydirt. 1-0 Pens.  The Sens put a late push on, Kyle Turris acts like a baby and starts slashing everyone within stick reach. Doesn't work Some Thoughts With all the Pittsburgh based media-driven narratives of  oh gee what has Phil done lately  kicking up, great that he scores the game's only goal. Great game for the Pens overall. They pretty much controlled the whole game. Not sure Ottawa really had more than one or two actual great scoring chances. Seemed like just a matter of time before the Pens won this one, unless Ottawa got something cheesy. Flip side of that, of course, is that in 6+ periods of this series so far, starting on the road Ottawa scored a total of 2 goals and still stole home ice back. Not really sure home ice actually matters, but they still won a game despite not really playing all that great with the puck. They have a good goalie and structure, but hopefully skill and a team actually trying to play hockey will prevail in the end. But, all the Pens could do today was win, and win they did. Took some tough injuries in Rust and Schultz (plus had Hornqvist who couldn't go tonight, don't forget) so that's costly. Let's see who's ready to go but now this goes to 1-1 and the Pens will have to carry on Wednesday night in the nation's capital.  "

"" Their response? Well, LOL. And another big W. Marc Methot, Derick Brassard and Zack Smith scored in a 2:18 span midway through the first period to chase goalie Marc-Andre Fleury and the Senators beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 5-1 on Wednesday night to take a 2-1 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. Hoffman opened the scoring 48 seconds in, and the Senators blew it open against the sluggish Penguins a few minutes later with the fastest three goals in team playoff history. Kyle Turris made it 5-0 late in the second period. ""If we played a run-and-gun game that maybe some people would rather watch, we probably wouldn't be here,"" Hoffman said after routing the defending Stanley Cup champs. ""So we use our assets and that's what works. "" Sidney Crosby ended Craig anderson 's shutout bid with a power-play goal in the third. Pittsburgh has scored a goal in each game in the series, dropping the opener 2-1 in overtime and winning the second 1-0. ""It was a bad start,"" Crosby said. ""You don't want to get down at any point, but to get down 4-0 is digging a pretty big hole. "" Anderson finished with 25 saves. Fleury allowed four goals on nine shots, and Matthew Murray made 19 saves in relief. Game 4 is Friday night in Ottawa. Coach Guy Boucher has insisted on an extremely defensive style from the day he took over the Senators last May. It took until December for the team to fully embrace it, but that's when everyone knew where they needed to be on the ice and what their responsibility was. ""At this level, you do what the coach says,"" said Hoffman, who also played for Boucher in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. ""We're workers here. We don't decide which system is put in place. We just have to go out there and execute it and do our job. ""That's what we're here to do. "" Hosting their first Eastern Conference final game in 10 years, the Sens came out flying. Hoffman got it going by capitalizing on Turris' shot that bounced awkwardly wide of the goal. Hoffman stuffed the shot, standing to the left of the goal, just between the post and right pad of Fleury. Brassard got the first of three when he snatched Erik karlsson 's dump-in and swung wide of the Pittsburgh goal. Bobby Ryan eventually gained possession down low and found Methot with a crafty pass. While his initial shot was stopped, the rebound bounced off Penguins defenseman Ian Coleand into the net. It was the second goal of the playoffs for Methot after he went scoreless in 68 games during the regular season. Brassard added his fourth of the postseason less than two minutes later, taking advantage of the Senators' offensive zone pressure before slipping behind the aging Mark Streit for the shot that beat Fleury. ""We're not bothered by what's said about our team,"" Brassard said. ""Our focus is on what we need to do. "" Streit was making his playoff debut for the increasingly battered Pens, who lost Justin Schultz and Bryan Rust to upper-body injuries in Game 2. Pittsburgh, which did get Trevor Daley back from injury, also remained without injured winger Patric Hornqvist as well as No. 1 defenseman Kris Letang, who's out for the season with a neck ailment. Apparent miscommunication between the 39-year-old Streit and Cole led to Cole throwing the puck away shortly before brassard 's goal. Ottawa, looking crisp and confident, finished the flurry 24 seconds after brassard 's goal, with Smith beating Fleury on a wrap-around, chasing Fleury from the game. ""It's tough when you give up that many goals in the first period you don't really give yourself or your team a chance in the game,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""It wasn't like we gave up a lot of scoring chances, we didn't, but they all seemed to go in the net. ""For me, the takeaway is you can't lose the first period by four goals and think you're going to win. "" In question now is whether Sullivan turns to Murray, who helped deliver the Pens a Cup last season and was excellent in his first full NHL season, for Game 4 or goes back to Fleury. ""I just think we've got to be more ready to play from the drop of the puck,"" said Sullivan, who added that he hadn't yet given thought to who would start in goal. The crowd was delirious throughout the one-sided win and all the more so when their team got under the skin of the Penguins. At one point late in the first, Dion Phaneuf levelled former Maple Leafs teammate Phil Kessel. Ryan came by with a shove seconds later as Kessel waved his stick in the air at the Sens winger in apparent frustration. Towel-waving fans chanted Kessel's name and later cheered as Mark Stonemixed it up with Evgeni Malkin.  ",Ross A,Sens dismantle Pens in 5-1 victory,"This was a statement game if Iêve ever seen one. The Ottawa Senators crushed the Pittsburgh Penguins 5-1, taking the lead 48 seconds in and keeping that lead for the whole game. There was no question who was going to win by the 12-minute mark of the game, when the Sens had already racked up a 4-0 lead and chased Marc-Andre Fleury. The game started how every Sens fan wouldêve wanted   first, with offensive pressure by the Sens, and second, with a goal just 48 seconds in. Mike Hoffman picked up a carom off the end boards and tucked it in behind Marc-Andre Fleury before the latter knew were the puck was. It was a heads-up play by a player the Sens could really use scoring goals again. I think many expected the Sens to just go into a shell, trying to protect the 1-0 lead, but to their credit they didnêt. They were aggressive on defence, forcing the Pens to get nothing other than unscreened shots from a distance. Then Ottawa would also get the second goal of the game. Derick Brassard got Fleury out of position on a wraparound attempt, but couldnêt really get a shot on goal. Rather than throwing it blindly in front, he held onto it and left it for Marc Methotpinching in from the point. A quick give-and-go between him and Bobby Ryan allowed Methot to put in a shot that hit Ian Cole, then Fleuryês skate, and ended up in the net for Methotês second goal of these playoffs (and 2nd in his last 86 games). Things would then go from good to better for the Sens. Brassard would pick up a sweet feed from Clarke MacArthur that Fleury had no chance on to make it 3-0. Then Zack Smith would pick up his own rebound, and wrap it around to tuck it in for a 4-0 lead. Before the second commercial break, Fleury was pulled and Matt Murray would see his first action of the playoffs.  The Sens would get a couple shots on Murray, and the Pens would get a couple scrambles in the Sensê end, but that would do it for first period scoring. If anyone had told you before the game the Sens would be up 4-0 at the end of the first, you probably wouldêve laughed them out of town, so I think itês safe to say it was a great outcome. As great as it was a to have a four-goal lead, everyone was a little tentative entering the second. As the commentators keep pointing out, this playoffs has seen a team overcome a multi-goal deficit to win 15 times. You knew that the Pens would have to set the tone early if they were going to come back. Thankfully, they didnêt. They had a couple chances, but really couldnêt get much going. Brassard drew a holding penalty on Trevor Daley a few minutes into the period, which reminded us all that there hadnêt been a powerplay yet in the game. As is tradition, the Pens got the first chance on the Sensê powerplay. However, Craig Anderson was ready and made a great save. Ottawa would then get a few chances, including a great Bobby Ryan tip on an Erik Karlsson point shot, but Murray was just as sharp. Alexandre Burrowswould take an awkward fall in front, limping off the ice and not returning in the game. Not long after, Brassard would force Chad Ruhwedel into a slashing penalty, sending Ottawa back to the PP. Once again, Ottawa got nothing going. Right after the penalty expired, Phil Kessel got a great opportunity right in front, but once again Andy was ready.  Pittsburgh would get a powerplay chance of their own. Dion Phaneuf, after getting away with roughhousing Kessel a couple times, didnêt get away with going after Evgeni Malkin. Smith actually slashed Coleês stick out of his hands in trying to touch the puck to get the whistle to start the penalty, which meant he probably got away with not giving up a straight-up 5-on-3. The Pens would have a couple chances on the PP, but 41 in goal was in pure Andy Ice form, calmly scooping up rebounds and squaring up the shooters. He looked so confident. With just under 2 minutes left in the period, Mike Hoffman got another great chance, but lost the handle 1-on-1. Thankfully, Kyle Turris picked up the puck, snuck around Murray, and tucked it in, giving Ottawa a 5-0 lead that would hold until the end of the period. Smith fell into Murray as the period expired, meaning Pittsburgh would at least get to start the third on the powerplay, but down by five goals. The third period felt like a formality. Ottawa easily killed the Pensê chance, and just as it ended, Matt Cullen decided to slash Fredrik Claesson. Both teams looked kind of lethargic on Ottawaês PP, and just as that one expired, the Sens would take another penalty. Zack Smith and Tom Pyatt would mostly play offensive zone catch to start that PK, but late on Kessel would hit Sidney Crosby with a pass in front of the net. Sid tucked it through Andersonês five-hole, breaking the shutout bid. That would do nothing to the pace of the game at all. Methot would draw yet another penalty, this time for slashing on Jake Guentzel, but the PP would be pretty sloppy for both teams. Brassard had a great chance to score in the dying seconds of it, but tipped the puck just wide. It started to feel like the Penguins had already realized they had no hope of coming back in the game. At the four-minute mark, Turris got a breakaway but rang it hard off the post. He and Crosby would exchange slashes afterward   if Turris is getting in Crosbyês head, that can only mean good things for the Sens. With two minutes left, Scott Wilson boarded Viktor Stalberg(no call) and then Mark Stone came in to tell him that wasnêt OK, giving the Penguins yet another powerplay. The refs tried to stay on top of things, even kicking out Malkin before the faceoff because they were unhappy with some of the things he was saying. Even more impressive was Malkin was playing the point, so he mustêve really been giving it. Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Smith would spend the first minute of the PK in the Pensê zone, again showing that the Sens were in complete control of the game. That would do it for the game, giving the Sens a commanding 5-1 victory over the Penguins. Notable Performances: Itês hard to pick bright spots in such a great game, but here are a few standouts. Derick Brassard: I think he was the Sensê MVP tonight. He was fast, hard on the forecheck, and in the middle of everything. He got a goal and an assist and couldêve had more, and finished at 88% on the faceoffs. Just a great game by a guy who was brought in as a playoff performer. Clarke MacArthur was also all over the ice, breaking up plays in Ottawaês zone and making things happen in the Penguinsê. Marc Methot looked poised as a defenceman with a nose for the net, finishing with two points on the night (his first multi-point game since March 21, 2015). I also liked how tough he was on Crosby. Fredrik Claesson also looked poised, and I think picked up some time in the third so Erik Karlsson only had to play 22 minutes. Claesson even played 1:30 of PK time, showing Boucher might be trusting him a bit more. You rarely praise the goalie in a blowout win, but Craig Anderson had another great game. He saved 25 of 26, on guys like Kessel and Crosby. Without a couple key saves, this game couldêve been more stressful. Matt Murray went 19/20 on the night, meaning it might be his entrance to the playoffs. Thatês the problem with these Penguins   itês not enough to shatter the confidence of just one of the goalies. Theyêre both starter quality. I am now 4-0 on recaps these playoffs. Unfortunately I canêt do Fridayês, but hey, I must be doing something right, right?  ",Pensburgh,"Pens pounded in Ottawa, lose 5-1","Pregame The Penguins have injury issues- Bryan Rust and Justin Schultz can't answer the bell for this game after getting knocked out in Game 2, and Patric Hornqvist remains out. So the team utilizes an extra defenseman and plays with 11 forwards. Mark Streit gets to make his 2017 playoff debut and Trevor Daley is back after missing the last 3 games with injury. 1st period The Senators start off fast early and the Pens are just kind of lackasdical in their defensive zone. A bit of bad luck with this puck taking a bounce off the outside of Nick Bonino's skate then a crazy hop off the boards right in front to Mike Hoffman who is in front of the net, compared to Olli Maatta who is not. Hoffman banks it past Marc-Andre Fleury to open the scoring less than a minute into the game. Ottawa keeps playing well and aggressively and they get another bounce, Marc Methot steps up and shoots, Fleury stops the puck but it bounces out and down to Ian Cole who accidentally sees the puck hit his skate and trickle past Fleury who kicks at it into his own net. 2-0 just like that. The onslaught continues, Bonino can't keep up with Bobby Ryan who makes a nice pass down to Derick Brassard who has a slam dunk goal due to Mark Streit not being in any semblance of position to defend against a wide-open man in front of the net. Oh. 3-0. Why not make it 4. Zach Smith lobs a dump-in high off the glass and outraces Brian Dumoulinto catch up with it. He somehow gets Fleury out of the net enough to go wide and wrap it in behind him. 4-zippy. 3 goals in 2:18 (and 4 in less than 20 minutes) means a goalie change. Tough one for Fleury. He's brought them here, tough to pile too much on him with a couple of bad bounces and a couple poor defensive plays but so it goes. The refs don't call this hit well away from the puck in a 4-0 game, because hey why start trying to enforce any sort of rules now, right? Shots 12-10 Ottawa. Score at 4-0 seems about out of reach. 2nd period The refs start calling penalties...But on the Penguins. Can't argue the calls made but nice job starting on them, stripes. Anyways Erik Karlsson makes some cool plays but Matt Murraymakes some stops and looks prettay prettay good. The Pens get a PP of their own and get some zone time and looks at the net but Craig Anderson is big when he has to be. Jake Guentzel hits yet another post. Kyle Turris gets on the board, going all hold-to-slingshot on Cole to get some space and score backhand. A Senator bumps Murray late in the period, they call that penalty but Evgeni Malkin also sends himself to the box by exchanging gloved punches with Mark Stone who also gets a penalty for it. 3rd period Meh who cares. At least Crosby gets off the schnide and taps in a PPG. Nice stick lift on Marc Methot. Time ticks away and luckily at least no one gets visibly injured in garbage time. Some Thoughts Tough night for Fleury. The first goal was a bad bounce (maybe he could have played tighter to the post?) just an unfortunate goal to surrender and that sort of set the tone for the game in what would follow. The 2nd goal was more bad luck, the 3rd Streit let him down and the 4th is one he probably wants back. Now, of course, the million dollar question is which goalie to start for Game 4 but I'm sure that will be widely debated over the next 2 days. Unless of course after this game Sullivan is smart enough to quench the flames and just name Fleury his starter for next game. Not staying up for his presser but I'm sure it will be good comment fodder. If Sullivan plays it coy and doesn't want to tip his goalie hand, that's his choice but it'll fan the flames and speculation, for sure. In a cruel irony, the Pens kept up, mostly, in scoring attempts. But not in goals. Luckily a garbage goal to avoid Sidney Crosby having 3 straight scoreless games for the first time this season. Luckily so that point doesn't have to be mentioned a million times in the next 2 days. The Penguins just have too many passengers, too many guys coasting along. Maybe it's injury, maybe it's fatigue, maybe it's bumps and bruises, who knows. About other than the big guns, no one really keeps the legs churning or was able to make basic plays. Usually they've gotten more (or maybe just better luck) from guys like Cole and Dumoulin too. Maatta/Daley, poor together all night, were victims again as well. But guys like Bonino...Hagelin...Sheary...Kunitz...Even Cullen..All had big moments last year. All basically invisible at best tonight, as for much of the playoffs. Need more from everyone but especially guys like that. Obviously this one got out of control and a depleted Pens team laid an egg. Still, no mercy will be asked for, or received so no sense of holding on too much to this one. All Pittsburgh can do is forget this one and put their best foot forward for Friday night to try and tie the series at 2 and take home-ice advantage back to PA for Game 5.  "

Crosby had a goal and an assist, Murray made 22 saves in his first start of the playoffs and the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the Ottawa Senators 3-2 on Friday night to even the Eastern Conference finals at 2-2. Crosby had only one point as the defending champion Penguins dropped two of the first three, leading to questions about his health following a jarring concussion in the second round. ""I think he leads by example and I thought he had one of his best games tonight,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""But it doesn't just stop with Sid, it goes down the bench. "" Murray started for the first time in more than six weeks. ""All I can really do is kind of jump in and try not to think about it,"" Murray said. ""Just try and play with the flow of the game and kind of let yourself get lost in the game a little bit. I thought I did a pretty good job of that tonight. There's a lot of ways I could have been a lot better I thought, but all together felt good about the game. "" Sullivan turned to Murray after Marc-Andre Fleury was chased in the first period Wednesday night in the Penguins' 5-1 loss in Game 3. ""I thought Matt was solid,"" Sullivan said. ""He made some timely saves for us when we needed it. He has a calm demeanor about him. I thought he was tracking the puck extremely well. And certainly, he made a couple of key saves for us at key times. "" Brian Dumoulin and Olli Maatta added goals to help Pittsburgh take a 3-0 lead midway through the second period. Clarke MacArthur and Tom Pyattscored for Ottawa. ""They were the better team tonight for two periods and they deserved the game,"" Senators coach Guy Boucher said. Game 5 is Sunday in Pittsburgh. Murray made a strong stop on Mike Hoffman less than two minutes into the game and denied Viktor Stalberg on a pair of follow-up opportunities. The goalie made maybe his best stop on Derick brassard 's backhander, kicking the shot away with his right pad. ""He made a really big save early on with his leg save when the guy kind of went around him after a rebound and I think right after that our team went into the offensive side and really played at the puck and gave us that momentum,"" teammate Chris Kunitz said. ""I think we did an all-around good job tonight. "" Fleury started the first 15 games for Pittsburgh with Murray mostly sidelined by injury. ""I don't want to make this about myself,"" Fleury said after the game. ""We scored some goals. That was nice. We won. It's good. "" Pittsburgh opened the scoring with 46 seconds left in the first period when Maatta went down the left side and fired a short-side shot past on goalie Craig Anderson. Crosby set up the play. Pittsburgh's already battered defense took another blow late in the first when Bobby Ryan hit Chad Ruhwedel. Ian Cole immediately throttled Ryan, as Ruhwedel was down on the ice. Ryan somehow escaped a charging penalty on the play, and Cole drew the only call for roughing. The Pens are already without Kris Letang, who is done for the playoffs, and Justin Schultz, who missed the last two games with an upper-body injury. Crosby's brilliance showed up again midway through the second on a power play after Jean-Gabriel Pageau ripped off the Pittsburgh star's helmet in a scrum around the net. Crosby stationed himself right on the doorstep to anderson 's left, his right leg hugging the post for support. That didn't allow him to score on the initial setup from Jake Guentzel, but helped him to bang in the follow-up for the 2-0 lead. Guentzel had two assists. Dumoulin made it 3-0 less than four minutes later with a shot from the left point that caromed in off Ottawa defenseman Dion phaneuf 's skate. Ottawa had mostly neutralized the high-powered Penguins in the first three games, holding them to just three goals - a mark they equaled in less than 32 minutes of Game 4. Pittsburgh seemed to find more speed, got more shots in tight and capitalized on opportunities around the net. Following that initial flurry in the first, the Senators had little going right until the last two minutes of the second when Ryan found MacArthur with a crafty backdoor pass for Ottawa's first goal. The Senators pulled within one with five minutes left when Pyatt got a skate on Erik karlsson 's already-deflected point shot. ""It's just a little frustrating right now,"" Karlsson said. ""They're doing a good job in controlling our breakouts and when we get it we don't really get the opportunities that we want. ""  ",Ary M,"Murray stands tall; Pens win Game 4, 3-2","Weêve been spoiled with the Sens late-game heroics: overtime winners, tying goals with less than 2 minutes left, game-winners in the third period   you name it. But hockey is a sport of bounces, and sometimes they donêt go your way. Unfortunately for the Senators, tonight was one of those nights.  The game started off well enough   eerily similar to Wednesdayês Game 3   and perhaps we should have known that the team not cashing in on Pens starter Matt Murray was a sign. After 4-5 scoring chances in the first 10 minutes, the game turned controversial in the latter half of the period. First, Mike Hoffman took a slashing penalty on Phil Kessel despite Ian Cole not getting called for the high stick on Kyle Turris earlier in the shift. The Pens didnêt score on the powerplay. However, with a minute left to play, Erik Karlsson jumped into the rush and took 3 good slashes from Chris Kunitz   elevated to play with Crosby tonight   and got stuck in deep. Olli Maatta led the charge the other way and scored a bad angle goal on Craig Anderson with Zack Smith defending in Karlssonês spot to give the Pens a 1-0 lead. What usually happens in hockey when the referees miss a call? The players take it into their own hands. Thus, the shift after, Bobby Ryan catches Chad Ruhwedel with his head down with an unfortunate hit, and Ian Cole jumps in to rescue his defender. Ruhwedel didnêt finish the game, and Cole ended up with the only penalty   a two-minute minor that extended into the second.  Letês get this out of the way now: the Senators PP was a tire-fire tonight, and if you believe in Çmomentumê, itês easy to point to the Sens poor PP play as a factor that not only sapped the energy out of the Senators, but gave life to the Penguins as the team went 0/4 on the night and still havenêt scored since Game 1 vs. the Rangers. As the post-whistle extracurriculars continued, Jean-Gabriel Pageau put Sidney Crosby into a headlock   a no-no generally but definitely against a player of Crosbyês caliber and injury history   leading to a two-minute minor. Crosby ended up being the beneficiary, grabbing his second point of the night and third of the series off a jam play on the right-side of the net after Jake Guentzel found him alone. Itês hard to blame a goaltender on a powerplay marker, but it was the second questionable goal against Anderson on the night, as he made the initial stop by took his left pad off the post for some reason on Crosbyês second attempt.  I thought that second goal woke the Sens up a bit, with Karlsson and Stone rushing in and looking active. Unfortunately, a too many men penalty against the Pens cost them (!) by putting them on the powerplay (!!), where the team looked dismal. I thought weêd get another Karlsson   Brassard magic moment later in the game after Karlsson barked at Turris on the benchafter the forward misplayed the puck back to Karlsson several times, but it never came to fruition. The Pens took advantage soon after the PK, with Brian Dumoulin getting his first of the playoffs after his centering pass to Malkin went off the skate of Dion Phaneuf and past Craig Anderson.  Although you could say that Pens controlled most of the second period   an impressive feat given they only had five defencemen   the Senators wounds were self-inflicted. The miscommunication appeared to pile up, and there was less support in the transition from defensive zone to offensive zone, leading to a period of ~10 minutes without an Ottawa shot on goal. As we know: bounces can change anything, and the Sens got some life with less than 2 minute left in the period. The goal came on an eventful shift for MacArthur   Brassard   Ryan. On the defensive zone draw, Brassard loses to Crosby but ends up tweaking something in his knee as he skated to the bench bowled over and went straight to the room.   As the play continued, Bobby Ryan blocked a shot with his upper body but ended up getting the puck on the right wing boards. Ron Hainsey fell, giving Bobby an advantage heading into the zone, but he mishandled the puck, leading to Pens defenders swarming into the zone. When all looked like it was lost, he spun and fired a no-look pass to the slot, where Clarke MacArthur deflected the puck past Matt Murray to break his shutout and get the Sens on the board heading into the third. Much like the first five minutes of the first, the Sens tested Murray quickly in the third period. The netminder was calm as he stopped multiple attempts from Stone, MacArthur, and Smith to keep the Sens at bay. The rest of the period was mainly played in the neutral zone, with the Sens looking to generate offensive zone pressure but the Pens doing a good job of playing The Ottawa Way and clearing the puck. It wasnêt until there was 5 minutes left when the Senators won their battle, with Erik Karlsson managing to get the puck through from the point, off Hoffmanês stick in the slot and Tom Pyattês skate in front of the net to bring the game to within 1. The Pens forecheck did a good job limiting Ottawa from getting Anderson pulled until the one minute mark, and I almost thought that there was going to be another comeback when the Pens took a bench minor with 34 seconds left. However, despite the best efforts of Turris, Karlsson, and Hoffman, the Sens were unable to get the puck past Matt Murray.  Notable Performances The Pens outshot the Sens by a margin of 35 - 24 for the night; although the 5-on-5 shot attempts were in the Sens favour, 43 - 39. The pair of Olli Maatta and Trevor Daley really stepped up for the Pens, with the two being among the Pens leaders in terms of shot attempts. The entire top-four split Ruhwedelês minutes, and if heês out long-term, we can expect to see Mark Streit back in for Game 5.  After going down two, the Sens effectively rolled 8 forwards. Dzingel - Wingels - Stalberg were all under 8 minutes, and Pyatt was ~13. Meanwhile, Turris, Smith, Hoffman, MacArthur, and Stone were all around 18-20 minutes.  Derick Brassard came back to start the third, but didnêt take any faceoffs; Zack Smith was on his line and took them instead. He looked to be skating fine if it really is a knee injury, but weêll wait for Boucher to confirm.  Just like Game 2 (which I also recapped, Iêm sorry), the Sens main problem looked like a combination of: a lack of puck support in the offensive zone and some poor puck management as a result. Unlike Game 2, the Sens still won the shot battle (a good sign), but will definitely like to get more pucks on Matt Murray in Game 5.  Funnily enough: the Senators actually did quite well in most metrics when you compare Game 3 to Game 4. More scoring chances, of better quality generally means more goals, but in single games, anything can happen. Of course, the large leads that both teams have greatly impact the CF% totals, but if we were to take two lessons out of the table below, it would be the following: 1) generate more shots on goal, 2) youêre playing quite well and the bounces donêt always go your way; reset for Game 5 (and maybe work on the powerplay)  ",Pensburgh,"Pens strike back, even series","Moving things around for Game Four. Here are your Penguins lines. Archibald with his playoff debut. Let's Go Pens!  The Penguins make two changes from last game, they scratch defenseman Mark Streit to go back to the regular 12F/6D alignment. Rookie Josh Archibald gets to make his NHL playoff debut. Oh and they decide to give Matt Murray his first start of the playoffs, almost forgot that one. The lines are all altered too, at least for warmups. 1st period The Pens start better, get some shots (though not very many high danger ones) but hey, gotta start somewhere and that's better than last game. The Senators generate a few good chances of their own but Murray holds strong. With less than a minute left in the period, the Pens are sprung on a 3-v-2 oddman rush, first such of the game. They make it count too. Sidney Crosby passes over to Olli Maatta Maatta skates in on Craig Anderson who has to stay deep in his crease, respecting the possible centering pass. Maatta flips the puck on the net and past Anderson. 1-0 Pens! As time continues to tick down the Sens double up with a pair of high, hard hits on Chad Ruhwedel, who is felled and bloodied after Bobby Ryan comes down the tracks and levels him with a huge hit. Ian Cole quite naturally objects and roughs Ryan up a little. He earns a penalty, which is understandable. No Senator does. Hmm. Ruhwedel is knocked out of the game and the Pens must press on with 5 defensemen. Shots are 14-9 Pens after 1. A bit misleading since the majority of them were non-threatening but they at least were able to establish a lot of offensive zone time and create some chaos in the o-zone. That's a lot more than you can say about Game 4. 2nd period The Pens take a couple more penalties, but the PK holds strong. Ottawa again decides to rough up the Penguins after a whistle for no reason and the refs finally put one of them in the penalty box for it (novel concept). On the ensuing Pittsburgh power play Jake Guentzel makes a great play and passes over to Crosby who keeps with a puck and it gets past the skate of Anderson in really what isn't that great of a goal against for such a hot goalie not to make it to the post by the second chance.  Of course, that's easy to say when Sid is bearing down on you, but how does his skate leave the post? Critical error that seemed avoidable. Pittsburgh keeps the push up. Defenseman Brian Dumoulin seemingly is trying to hit Evgeni Malkin with a pass but the puck bounces off Dion Phaneuf and redirects straight into the net. They don't ask how, they ask how many. And right now it's 3-0. Malkin thanks Phaneuf for the gift. Which, considering phaneuf 's back was to the puck to try and take a hack at Geno's hands, that's gotta be a sweet sense of retribution. Pittsburgh doesn't escape the period unscathed. Ryan makes a great pass down that Clarke MacArthur gets a stick on right in front of the net past Murray to make it 3-1. Shots 28-16 Pittsburgh after 2. Gotta love that and without looking that almost certainly has to be the most lopsided SOG (in favor of Pens) all playoff long. 3rd period Back and forth we go, Kessel gets a breakaway but Anderson stands tall. The Sens get within 1 with 5 minutes to go. Erik Karlsson unleashes a shot that tips off someone in front, then clicks off the skate of Tom Pyatt and in past Murray. Hold on to your butts it's 3-2. Ottawa keeps pressing and gets another power play with a 2nd too many men on the ice. Sens push, including a wide-open slapper by Karlsson and Murray stones him. Very reminiscent of a certain Penguins goalie stoning an all-world Swedish defenseman on the doorstep in the dying seconds of the game....Hmm, where have we seen THAT before? Game, set, match, even at 2 games, so now we're down to a best of 3. Some Thoughts The Sens power play is 0 for its last 24 and looks like it too. They're hardly getting zone time, let alone good shots let alone good chances. Power plays don't stay cold forever but this one looks very poor indeed. Nice to see the Pens show the gas tank isn't quite on E just yet. Nice to see a response from them. In the great goalie debate of 2016-17 (part 107,303), Mike Sullivan made the wise choice. Murray looked strong and in control. Ottawa was outshot but they had several good chances at 5v5, Murray turned them away, aside from 2 unstoppable. Fleury's done the same in games in the past, but Murray gave them what they needed tonight. This mission, accomplished. Now onto the next one. Ruhwedel was the 3rd and last healthy RHD on the roster, aside from black ace Frank Corrado who's way down on the depth chart. The team found a way without him, but something to consider if his absence stretches into next game. Presumably Mark Streit or Derrick Pouliot would be the next man up. Down that d-man most the game, the team leaned on Maatta (25 minutes) and Trevor Daley (23 minutes overall) as the top ES minutes-eaters on the team. Nice way to fight through things for the Pens, down a couple guys, they found a way. Wasn't always pretty but it counts. Great to see Dumoulin and Nick Bonino sell out late to block shots and preserve the win. Not sure what to think about Sullivan casually on camera saying  what happened?  after each of the 2 too many men calls against the Pens. Pittsburgh needs to clean up changes and be much better next time out. Seems like a recurring problem, so Sully needs to figure out what is happening and correct it. Surely that's not breaking any news for him. Pens are 12-2 under Sullivan this year and last the next game after a lose. That's how you make deep runs, just find a way to bounce back. Down now to a best of 3, winner going on to the Stanley Cup Final. Given how this series has unfolded, that's not a bad position to be in. A pivotal Game 5 is coming up with a fairly quick turnaround on Sunday afternoon in Pittsburgh.  "

"" It means he wants his team to attack opponents with speed, aggression and a dash of responsibility. Physically translated, it looks like the 60 minutes the defending Stanley Cup champions put together Sunday in a 7-0 demolition of the Ottawa Senatorsin Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Final. Dominant from the opening faceoff to the final whistle, the Penguins moved within one game of a return trip to the Cup final by overwhelming the Senators with wave after wave of pressure, the kind that became the club's trademark during its sprint to a fourth championship last spring. Seven players scored and 11 finished with at least one point to give Pittsburgh a 3-2 lead heading into Game 6 on Tuesday in Ottawa. Seemingly on the ropes after getting pummeled 5-1 in Game 3, the Penguins have outscored the Senators 10-2 over the last six periods to gain control. ""When we play the type of game we play tonight it allows us to dictate the terms and play the style and the identity of this Penguins team,"" Sullivan said. One well aware that despite how easy it looked during its most lopsided playoff victory in five years, much work remains to be done. ""They have a good ability to respond, so we're going to be challenged here in Game 6,"" said Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby, who scored for the third straight and became the 22nd player in NHL history to reach 100 career playoff assists when he sent a slick backhand no-look pass to Phil Kesselearly in the third period. ""We know that and we've got to be at our best. "" The Penguins might already be there. The power play went 3 for 3. The penalty kill turned the Senators away four times and extended Ottawa's power play drought to 0 for 29. Matt Murray stopped 21 shots for his first playoff shutout in Pittsburgh's most complete performance of the postseason. ""I think that was a big part of our success last year was that we had all four lines going and chipping in offensively,"" forward Matt Cullen said. ""But more than that, spending time in the offensive zone and grinding and playing some good hockey and I think the last couple games, especially, that's been key. "" The Senators quieted the Penguins early in the series, holding them to three goals through three games by playing disciplined hockey. It collapsed in the first period on Sunday, as turnover after turnover kept giving Pittsburgh the kind of chances that makes it such a difficult out this time of year. The Penguins chased Ottawa's Craig Anderson by beating him four times in the first period, the last a  why not  flip from behind the goal line by fourth-line forward Scott Wilson that banked in off the goalie. Replacement Mike Condon didn't fare much better. When Cullen beat him 1:54 into the second to make it 5-0, the competitive portion of the afternoon over. As if to raise the white flag, Ottawa coach Guy Boucher held defenseman Erik Karlsson, forward Derick Brassard and defenseman Cody Ceci out of the final 20 minutes to help them get rested up for Game 6. Karlsson, who is playing with two hairline fractures in his left heel, said he will""absolutely"" be ready for Game 6. The rest of the Senators insist they'll be ready too. They became the third team this postseason to lose by at least six goals. The other two - Edmonton in the first round against San Jose and Anaheim in the second round against the Oilers - came back to win the next game and eventually the series. ""Just like a plumber wakes up one day, is having a great day, the other day he's not having a good day,"" Boucher said. ""Just one of those bad days. "" NOTES: Bryan Rust had a goal and an assist in his return from a concussion that sidelined him for Games 3 and 4. ... Olli Maatta and Trevor Daley also scored for Pittsburgh. ... The margin of victory was the largest in a conference final since Detroit beat Colorado 7-0 in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. ...

Kessel picked him up by the side of the road and brought him to the arena.  ",Beata Elliott,Sens Get Blown Out 7-0 by Pens in Game 5,"I donêt even know what to say. For the first time since the playoffs started, I am truly at a loss for words. Whatês worse? I donêt even really want to talk about the Sens. I donêt want to relive the game through the recap. I donêt want to wear a Sens jersey in public so that I can talk to strangers about the team. All I want to do is get in my car, go see Gifted at my nearest movie theater, and forget this game ever happened. I actually cancelled plans to watch this game. I figured I didnêt want to miss the most important Sens game of these playoffs, but I guess this team didnêt get that _most important gameÓ memo. In fact, this game was such a waste of time that Iêm not even writing this intro at the end of the game, but during the third period, which I simply cannot bring myself to devote my full attention to. So if youêre reading this, that means the Sens continued to play like utter crap in the third period and I had no need to edit this before publishing. So thatês great. Sorry Silver Seven readers, you guys deserve better. You know who else deserves better? Every single Senatorsfan who gave up three hours of their long weekend to watch this. Oh look! Itês 7-0 now. Just wonderful. Realistically, I know the series isnêt over yet. This team has given us every reason to believe theyêll manage to bounce back after a bad game and even the series at home. Maybe, by the end of the week, weêll get to look back on this game and laugh at ourselves for thinking the sky was falling after one blowout loss. But good god, that was embarrassing.  The first big disappointment in the game happened just minutes before it began: Guy Boucher got our hopes up by having Colin White skate in the warmup, then crushed them by announcing he was going to play 7 defensemen instead. While the decision to dress an extra defenseman was a little weird, I can fully understand why Boucher didnêt want to try out an untested rookie in such an important game. However, the idea of White drawing into the lineup was extremely exciting as a fan, and it was disappointing to have that hope ripped away at the last minute. The first period looked a lot like a role reversal of game 3, with Pittsburgh firing on all cylinders and Ottawa looking like they just got out of bed. The Sens got a lucky break when the refs didnêt notice that they had too many men on the ice, and spent a brief period of time in the Penguinsê zone before reverting back to the sleepy, messy play that would persist throughout the remainder of the game. Unsurprisingly, Pittsburgh scored early, off a brutal turnover by Mike Hoffman and a series of bad defensive plays in the Ottawa zone. The Sens got an opportunity to finally end their power play slump, but instead gave up a shorthanded breakaway that thankfully didnêt lead to a goal against. Stone then heroically neutralized the powerplay with a pretty questionable penalty. The Penguins scored two more goals without much happening in between. Ottawa looked about as bad as they did against New York in games 3 and 4, without any life in them at all. It was, to put it simply, painful to watch. Neither of the first three goals were entirely Craig Andersonês fault, but Boucher decided to pull him in favour of Mike Condon. Whether it was mercy, an attempt to shake things up, or a belief that Anderson wasnêt playing well, weêll probably never know, but itês not like it made a difference in the end. Strangely, Condon was only in net for a few minutes before Boucher went back to Anderson for the remainder of the first period. Pittsburgh went up 4-0 off a slightly fluky goal that nevertheless should not have happened, and the Sens went back to the dressing room having dug themselves a hole they were clearly not in any mood to climb out of. Condon returned to the net for the second period, and the poor guy would stay in for the rest of the game. The frame started off with quite possibly the only good Senators scoring chance of the entire game, which Brassard failed to convert on. *Cue fireworks.* Any hope of a miraculous comeback was quickly dashed when Pittsburgh went up 5-0 and the Sens failed to produce anything resembling a decent scoring chance. At this point, the Sensê only objective should have been to rest their stars and avoid injuries. But even that didnêt work out for them! Brassard, who has undoubtedly been one of Ottawaês best forwards during this run, was slow to get up after a hit to the head from Chris Kunitz. The hit wasnêt actually that dirty - Kunitz hit him with his forearm instead of his elbow - and Brassard is probably fine, but at that point it really felt like nothing would ever go right for the Sens. Then, as if things couldnêt get any worse, Karlsson went to the dressing room after hurting his foot, and didnêt return for the remainder of the game. It sucks that that happened, and losing Karlsson would certainly spell the end of this playoff run, but I wouldnêt panic just yet: thereês a good chance he was just resting because there was no point in keeping him in for a blowout loss. Also, Cody Ceci did not take the ice for the third period (insert _but Ceci NEVER shows up!Ó joke here). Iêm not the biggest Ceci fan (see: previous sentence), but heês still better than the guys behind him, and itês never a good thing to lose a player at this point in the season. Letês all hope heês okay. And then the Sens scored 5 goals in the third period and won in overtime. Yup. Totally happened. Pittsburgh did not score two more goals. Ottawa did not play like garbage. We all went home happy. Itês 2017 and I am choosing to believe this particular bit of #FakeNews. Iêm not even going to bother with Notable Performances tonight, because everyone was bad and I donêt feel like picking it apart. However, I do want to finish this on a positive note, so I want to remind you of four moments from the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs that can give us all a tiny dash of hope. Game 4 of the first round series between the Sharks and the Oilers. The Oilers lose 7-0, then bounce back and win their next 2 games on their way to a series win. Game 6 of the second round series between the Oilers and the Ducks. The Ducks lose 7-1, then go on to win game 7 and advance to the Conference Finals. Game 2 of the first round series between the Senators and the Bruins. Boston is up 3-1 after two periods, with a chance to head home with a 2-0 series lead. I donêt know about you guys, but at that point I was thanking every deity I knew of that the Sens were embarrassing themselves against the Bruins instead of the Leafs. We all know what happened after that. Games 3 and 4 against the Rangers in the second round. Remember how demoralized we all were? We didnêt think there was any way the Sens could come back and win the series. See? History is on our side. This game sucked, and weêre allowed to be mad about it. Weêre also allowed to be mad about all the missed opportunities in games 2 and 4, which the Sens didnêt show up for either. But letês not pretend this series is already over. After all, anything can happen in the playoffs, and this team has made a habit of doing the impossible. We can still do this. Sens in 7.  ",Pensburgh,"Penguins dominate, take 3-2 series lead","Pregame With Tom Kuhnhackl and Chad Ruhwedel both out due to injuries, Head Coach Mike Sullivan had to dig a little deeper with his Penguins lines and   stop me if you heard this before   stretch the depth of his defensive pairings. Because of that fact, Mark Streit got another chance to prove himself after a disappointing performance in Game 3. That being said, we saw some good news on the injury front with Big Time Playoff Guy Bryan Rust returning to the lineup as the right-winger with Nick Bonino and Carter Rowney on the third forward line. Thatêll hopefully keep the offense hungry and charging, rather than setting back and being next-to-non-existent like we noticed them do a couple games back.  Itês also clear that Matt Murray officially earned back his net in Game 4 and will be the go-to starting goaltender for Pittsburgh from here on out.  Our mother Twitter was definitely keeping things light heading into puck drop. Game on. 1st Period Ottawa came out of the gates with another aggressive start, but the Pens easily weathered it with a couple good rushes on their own. A fun, little factoid for the Senatorsê lines was reported early on and probably had the attention of Sullivan: Rust made a solid, early impression with a few great chances up front on Craig Anderson, as well as negating an icing to keep the offense pressing on (this was no doubt missed during his injury). Around the 16 minute mark, we saw the same typical NHL refs in the playoffs missing a very obvious too many men on the ice effort by the Sens on a messy line change. No whistle. Play went on.  _Whatês the matter with Maatta?Ó Nothing, folks! The Finnish boy wonder buried his second goal in two games from the left circle off a beautiful feed by Rust. Pens went up 1-0 with 11:40 left to play in the first. A soft tripping call on Matt Cullen sent Ottawa on its first power play of the game, but the ice seemed to tip in the Penguinsê favor after a speedy, breakaway try by Carl Hagelin was kicked aside by Anderson. Less than a minute later, Mark Stone was sent to the box for slashing. We had 4-on-4 play for about a minute. Pittsburgh, for what seems like the first time this ECF series, continuously got behind the Senatorsê defense. It proved fruitful as it dropped into the Sensê zone, and on a great blue line keep and pass by Evgeni Malkin, the Russian center connected to Trevor Daley who sent a rocket to the net that got tipped in by Sidney Crosby. 2-0 Pittsburgh thanks to a power play tally.  PPG Paints Arena was absolutely electric. The Penguins had complete control after that second goal, and Bonino capitalized on it off a horrible turnover by Ottawa right in front of its crease with a goal of his own. Pittsburgh went up three goals with less than four minutes to go in the first frame. That seemed like enough for Ottawa Head Coach Guy Boucher, as he stripped Anderson of his rights as the Game 5 goalie. Mike Condon stepped in to take his place. That lasted maybe a minute. Anderson oddly returned almost immediately after the switch. The Senators still had absolutely no answer to the beating the Penguins were giving them. Keeping Anderson in net was a really bad idea. A sharp angled shot slipped past the starting netminder for the fourth time this period by Pittsburghês Scott Wilson. The Pens took a 4-0 lead, and this game kept getting uglier and uglier. I was barely able to keep up with all the scoring updates. My fingers couldnêt type fast enough. Yikes, Ottawa. 2nd Period Anderson, once again, took a seat on the bench, and Condon set up shop in Ottawaês goal at the start of the second period. We didnêt see any more flip-flopping for the rest of the contest. Rightfully so. Unfortunately for the Senators, that game plan didnêt last very long. Cullen, off a pretty feed by Streit after a line change, led the chorus to the same old song and dance with his own strike right in front of Condon to grow the lead to 5-0. That was Rowneyês third, consecutive assist of the game. He had only four in his first 38 games (regular season plus playoffs). Thatês outstanding. Ottawa looked completely helpless. About halfway into the second, Bonino got nailed for a high sticking call, sending Ottawa on a much-needed power play. Pittsburgh had no trouble killing it, and gained even strength back pretty easily. With a minute left to play, the Senators traded a PP for a PK with a penalty of their own on Tommy Wingels for roughing. A few impactful scoring opportunities carried the Penguins through the rest of the period. 3rd Period Pittsburgh began the final frame with time still left on the roughing penalty to Wingels. Just like the two previous periods, the Pens lit up the scoreboard again, this time being on the power play off of Phil Kesselês stick. Crosby picked up the primary helper by giving a gorgeous between-the-legs pass across the Condonês crease. Pittsburgh went up half a dozen to zero with loads of time left in the game. Rust took a bad slashing penalty at 14:35 after Ben Harpur put him down on the ice with a clean hit. Ottawa went on another power play looking to generate any life. Erik Karlsson was notably benched for the last remaining minutes of the game. Regardless of if it was due to another injury apart from his foot fracture or just that they wanted him to rest, it was a smart move by Boucher; you donêt need your best player taking unnecessary minutes in a blow out. Touchdown, Penguins. On another power play chance, Daley rocketed a shot from the top of the point that met the back of the net thanks to a great screen by Wilson on Condon. Pittsburgh went up 7-0 at the 11:11 mark. A few typically perfect saves by Murray closed out the game. What a time to be a Pittsburgh fan. Some Thoughts I must say, the Penguins, as a team, looked fast again and played phenomenally. Thereês just no knocking their dominance right now. The third and fourth lines have been machines that keep churning out points. I canêt stress enough how important the play of the bottom two lines with Rowney and Archibald (!), the ones that have seen the most changes due to injuries, is to a team limping their way through the playoffs. The trap on the 1-3-1 the Senators lived on in the first half of the series has been completely shut down by bruising defenseman on the blue lines and utilizing a dump and chase strategy. Expect Pittsburgh to keep doing this until the oil runs out. The Pens finally found some constant success on the power play with all three units scoring today. Thatês a total game-changer in games that carry this much weight. Mike Sullivan is a genius and no one should ever question his decision making on line pairings or starting goalies.  Pittsburgh now has a one-game lead heading into Game 6 after giving an absolute whipping to a battered Senators team. A 3-2 advantage bodes well with two games remaining in the ECF series with home ice (if needed) to close it all out. Should be a fun handful of days to come.  "

Anderson stopped 45 shots, Mike Hoffman scored the tiebreaking goal early in the third period and the Senators beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 2-1 Tuesday night to force a decisive Game 7 in the Eastern Conference Finals. The 36-year-old Anderson was coming off a pair of rough outings, including Sunday when he was pulled after yielding four goals in Ottawa's 7-0 loss in Game 5 at Pittsburgh. ""You can't change what happens in the past,"" said Anderson, who has credited work with a sports psychologist early in his career for helping him manage the mental side of the game. ""From that moment on you have to look forward and get ready for the next one. "" Hoffman fired a slap shot through traffic off a pass from Fredrik Claesson to put the Senators ahead at 1:34 of the third. Bobby Ryan also scored a rare power-play goal for Ottawa. It was quite a response after the drubbing in the previous game. ""I think the biggest message for us was if somebody told us back in training camp in September that we'd have an opportunity to win Game 6 in the Eastern Conference final at home in front of our fans we would've taken it,"" Ryan said. ""So let's not dwell, let's not kick ourselves and put our heads down. Let's embrace this opportunity to extend this for two more days together and go from there. "" Evgeni Malkin gave Pittsburgh, vying for its second straight trip to the Stanley Cup Final, the lead early in the second period and Matt Murrayfinished with 28 saves. ""I thought we played a real good game,"" Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. ""I thought we dominated zone time. We had lots of chances. We didn't score tonight. The puck didn't go in the net, but if we continue to play the game that way, then I believe we'll get the result. "" Game 7 is Thursday night in Pittsburgh, with the winner advancing to face the Nashville Predators for the championship. Ottawa was primarily looking for a return to structure in Game 6, beginning with a smoother start - which they got. Notable in a scoreless opening period were two effective penalty kills, one of which saw Viktor Stalberg get the best opportunity short-handed. Pittsburgh had four shots with the man advantage, but Anderson stopped them all. It was evident early that he had his game back in this one. He stopped Nick Bonino off a rebound in transition, Scott Wilson off a deflected shot by Phil Kessel, and Bonino again when Kyle Turris gave the puck away. Anderson then stopped 22 of 23 shots in the second period. ""I think Anderson was the reason that they got this one, he played big for them,"" Murray said. ""But in our room we just focus on what we need to do. We played really well, we just didn't get the bounces and weren't able to put one home. "" anderson 's performance was a reminder for Senators coach Guy Boucher of why he took the job with Ottawa in the first place last May. ""I'll be honest with you, if I didn't have a No. 1 goalie, I didn't want the job,"" Boucher said. ""I've lived it for quite a few years, and it's hell when you don't have it because everything you do turns to darkness, and there's nothing that really matters when you don't have a real No. 1 goaltender. ""It's like a quarterback in football and a pitcher in baseball, and we have it,"" Boucher added. Murray was also sharp. The 22-year-old, who replaced Marc-Andre Fleuryafter Game 3, made maybe his finest save of the first on Derick Brassard, who found an open lane down the middle of the ice following a pass from Ryan. The Penguins appeared to have opened the scoring just over three minutes into the second, but Trevor Daley was deemed to have interfered with Anderson following an Ottawa challenge. Less than two minutes later though, Pittsburgh took the 1-0 lead anyway off a few moments of brilliance from Malkin. The playoff scoring leading (24 points) bounced off a check from Zack Smith behind the goal and after being stopped on his drive to the net, followed up with a nifty backhand rebound to beat Anderson. It was the 153rd career playoff point in 142 games for Malkin - three back of Sidney Crosby for second among active players behind Jaromir Jagr - who had been jarring with Hoffman a few minutes earlier. The Senators had little going until a lengthy 5-on-3 advantage for 1:24 just past the midway point of the period. The Ottawa power play, which had gone 0 for 29 in the previous 10 games, came through with Ryan ultimately wiring a one-timer short-side to tie the score. It was the sixth goal and 15th point of the playoffs for Ryan, who is second on the Senators behind captain Erik Karlsson (16 points).  ",nkb,Sens Beat Pens 2-1,"Amazing what a difference a few hours makes it, isnêt it? In the lead-up to tonightês game, the mood surrounding the Ottawa Senators could have not been more dour for a team just two wins away from playing for the Stanley Cup; a resounding 7-0 defeat in their last outing and a seemingly dismal crowd for what might have been the last game of the season will do that. It wouldnêt be this yearês edition of the Sens without one more plot twist, though: Ottawa held on for a 2-1 victory tonight over the defending Stanley Cup Champions Pittsburgh Penguins, and now weêre headed for a winner-takes-all Game 7 on Thursday.  The aforementioned dark clouds aside, there were several intriguing on-ice story lines.  To name just a few: After somewhat inexplicably going with a 11F-7D configuration in game 5, Guy Boucher turned to Colin White and Ryan Dzingel to play on his fourth line. Could they be effective? Could Ottawa slow down a Pittsburgh power play that had scored on its last three opportunities with seeming impunity? Could Ottawa score on a power play of their own for the first time since....well, since the second round against the Rangers? Could Craig Anderson bounce back after getting pulled in Game 5? Believe it or not, the answer to all of these questions proved to be: yes. Though White and Dzingel, along with Stalberg, played only a handful of minutes the trio held its own when it was out there. Boucher sheltered the line to an almost comical degree, deploying them only for offensive zone draws against either Pittsburghês third or fourth lines, but they did their job when called upon.  Much more importantly, the Senators killed all three Pittsburgh power plays including two in the first period. The Pens looked dangerous on several occasions with the man advantage, most notably on a 4-on-2 after Viktor Stalberg and Zack Smith had just had a chance on Matt Murray, but the Ottawa penalty bent without breaking.  It should be said here that a lot of the Sens success tonight, not just on the penalty kill but throughout the game, was owing to the spectacular play of Craig Anderson. On the whole, Ottawa was outplayed tonight. For a stretch in the second period, they were outplayed badly. Sometimes the shot clock can be a bit misleading, but in this case it was not: But also, sometimes, a goalie simply steals a game for you. Goalies are an important part of good teams, and itês nearly impossible to win a championship without competent goaltending. Craig Anderson is a great goalie, and the Sens badly needed him to bounce back tonight. He did. After a scoreless first period that featured the previously mentioned penalty kills, and a few Sensê chances that didnêt amount to much, Ottawa was on its heels for most of the second period. Pittsburgh even appeared to score a goal less than five minutes into the frame but the tally was disallowed after Boucher successfully challenged on the basis of goalie interference. Trevor Daley certainly jammed Anderson into his net as he swiping at the puck, but the reversal only delayed the inevitable: Evgeni Malkin scored on a terrific individual effort 4:51 into the period. Staring at elimination for the first time all year, really staring at it, didnêt seem to immediately wake the Sens up but a power play, of all things, did the trick. After Jean-Gabriel Pageau drew an interference penalty on Ron Hainsey, Kyle Turris was high-sticked in the face by Ian Colewith Ottawa already up a man and the Sens were gifted a lengthy 5v3 to tie the game. For once, the power play not only looked great but delivered a crucial goal: Escaping from a period in which they ended up being outshot 23 (!!) to 10 with a 1-1 tie was about all you could ask for.  Iêm not sure what exactly was said between the second and the third period, but Ottawa looked like a very different team to start the final frame. They were rewarded for their efforts with a goal from Mike Hoffman off a pass from Fredrik Claesson Hoffmanês had something of an up and down play-off run, but his skill is undeniable and to win play-off series you need game-breakers. When the Sens needed a goal, he delivered. Big points to Claesson for jumping into the rush as he did as well. This goal doesnêt happen if he doesnêt read the play and cut right up the middle of the ice to lead the breakout. The rest of the third was largely spent defending the slimmest of margins. Anderson answered the call again and again, and Erik Karlsson played an inhuman number of minutes to help preserve the advantage. Sidney Crosby had perhaps the best chance to tie it from right in close with fewer than five minutes to play but Anderson got his blocked on the one-timer. As the final seconds ticked away, Sens fans were probably alternating between gasping for breath and screaming their lungs out. It wasnêt a perfect game, but at this stage all that matters is the win.  The Sens are one win away from the Stanley Cup final. Hard to say it hasnêt been fun. Notable Performances: Craig Anderson: Andy was easily the best player on either team tonight, stopping 45 of the 46 shots he faced. Pittsburgh could have buried the Sens in the second period but Anderson was the difference. Fredrik Claesson: A big assist on the winning goal, Claesson also made several strong plays with the puck. Evgeni Malkin: Malkin was the Penguinsê best player tonight and I was genuinely terrified every time he stepped on the ice. Bobby Ryan: Bobby got the tying goal and had several strong plays with the puck. Took the one foolish penalty, but the Sensê PK made sure it wasnêt a costly error. The Crowd: The final tally, according to NHL.com, was 18,111 but boy was it loud at the Canadian Tire Centre tonight. The atmosphere was incredible; kudos to everyone that made it so.  ",Pensburgh,Ottawa forces another one with 2-1 win,"Pregame As expected, the Penguins stick with the same lineup for Game 6 as the big win in Game 5. 1st period No score. 2 power plays for the Pens but they can't convert. Seems the course of play mainly favors Pittsburgh, 11-9 SOG, 23-17 overall in shot attempts. 32 faceoffs though, very fragmented type of start. 2nd period Trevor Daley sticks with a loose puck that Craig Anderson can't quite get to and Daley scores. Ruled a good goal on the ice. The Senators challenge and the refs agree, no goal. Close but pretty surprised they saw enough to reverse. Can't be too mad about any sort of contact with a goalie in his crease, but this one seemed close. Only in a league like the NHL does the tie not go to increasing scoring. But Pittsburgh doesn't sit on laurels. Evgeni Malkin absolutely takes Zach Smith to school, collects his own rebound and backhands it by Anderson to make it 1-0. They ain't takin' this one back. Unlike a fairly even 1st, this one's all Pittsburgh; 16-4 in shots in the 2nd at one point. But then things go south when arguably the 2 best PK'ing defensemen on the team in Ron Hainsey and Ian Cole each take penalties within a minute of each other. That's not ideal. Ottawa strikes on the ensuing 5v3 for their first power play goal of the series (and a long time) when Kyle Turrisfinds Bobby Ryan for a one-timer. 1-1. Shots 34-19 for the Pens after 2. 3rd period Early on, the Pens get caught up ice and Ottawa goes on a 3-on-2. Mike Hoffman waits for traffic in front and unleashes a terrific shot. 2-1 Ottawa. Pens push but can't break through. Tip of the hat for Anderson. 2-1 win for them, Game 7 on Thursday. Some Thoughts Shots 46-30 Penguins tonight. First time the best team in the game didn't win this one. Can't be too mad, Pittsburgh's been on the other end of this one a lot with the goalie stealing the game. Game 7. Home ice. Oh boy, here we go.  "

The veteran forward's contract is up this summer and he's been around long enough to know how these things go, particularly when you're 37. ""It's not fun thinking about the future,"" Kunitz said. He found a pretty compelling way to put it off for at least four more games and push his team to the brink of history in the process. Kunitz's knuckling shot from outside the circle fluttered past Craig Anderson5:09 into the second overtime to give the defending Stanley Cup champions a 3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference final Thursday night. Thrust alongside old linemate Sidney Crosby as the game wore on, the two reconnected for a goal that moved the Penguins closer to becoming the first team since the 1998 Detroit Red Wings to win back-to-back titles. Crosby sent a soft backhand pass from the right faceoff circle to Kunitz and for a moment, it seemed like old times. ""With the way he was holding the stick you could tell he wanted it bad,"" Crosby said. ""I just tried to lay it there for him. I've seen him score from there pretty often. It was a huge goal for us, and a great reward for him for the way he played all night. "" Kunitz scored twice, his first two of the playoffs. Justin Schultz added the other in his return from an upper-body injury, and Matt Murray stopped 27 shots on his 23rd birthday. The Penguins will host Western Conference champion Nashville in Game 1 on Monday night. Not bad for a team that watched so many of its core players - from defenseman Kris Letang to Evgeni Malkin to Crosby - deal with some serious bumps along the way. And yet here they are on the doorstep to a title once again. ""If you look at the amount of guys who have played on this roster throughout the course of the year, it's a lot of guys,"" Crosby said. ""The biggest step is ahead. "" Mark Stone and Ryan Dzingel scored for Ottawa. The Senators rallied twice to tie it, with Dzingel making it 2-2 with 5:19 left in regulation. Craig Anderson made 39 saves, but couldn't get a handle on Kunitz's shot as the Senators fell to 0-6 in Game 7s in franchise history. Just don't call them cursed. A year ago, Ottawa didn't even make the playoffs yet they found a way to push the Penguins to the 85th minute of Game 7 of the conference finals. ""We wanted to make then earn it and they earned it, rightfully so,"" said Senators defenseman Erik Karlsson, who assisted on both of Ottawa's goals and played the entire postseason with a pair of hairline fractures in his left heel. ""We got to give it to them. They were the better team. "" The Senators forced a return trip to Pittsburgh - where they lost 7-0 in Game 5 on Sunday - by leaning heavily on Anderson in a 2-1 Game 6 victory. Ottawa coach Guy Boucher told his team to not get caught up in the big picture but instead focus on the small ones, a recipe that carried the Senators throughout a bumpy transition under their first-year head coach to within a victory of the franchise's second Cup appearance. The Penguins, trying to become the first defending champion to return to the Final since Detroit in 2009, came in confident they would advance if they could replicate their dominant Game 6, when they were undone only by anderson 's brilliance. Pittsburgh has been nearly unflappable in the face of adversity under Mike Sullivan, and is now 13-2 in playoff games following a loss over the last two springs. ""I couldn't be more proud of our team for just its `sticktoitiveness,""' Sullivan said. ""The last four games of this series, we found our game. "" Kunitz ended a 25-game playoff goal drought when he completed a 2-on-1 with Conor Sheary - a healthy scratch in Games 5 and 6 - by slipping the puck by Anderson 9:55 into the second period. The momentum lasted all of 20 seconds. Ottawa responded immediately with Stone - who stretched his left skate to stay onside - fired a wrist shot that handcuffed Murray . Pittsburgh kept coming. Schultz, returning after missing four games with an upper-body injury, zipped a shot from the point through Kunitz's screen and into the net with 8:16 left in the third. Once again, the Penguins could not hold the lead. Dzingel set up at the right post and banged home a rebound off Erik karlsson 's shot that hit the left post and caromed off Murray's back right to Dzingel's stick . Unbowed, Pittsburgh continued to press. The Penguins pumped eight shots at Anderson in the first overtime before finally breaking through when Kunitz won just the fourth multiple-overtime Game 7 of a conference final in NHL history. The next step, the last step, awaits. NOTES: The home team is 21-20 in overtime Game 7s in NHL playoff history. ... Pittsburgh F Patric Hornqvist skated during warmups, but was held out of the lineup for a sixth straight game with an upper-body injury. ... Karlsson had 16 assists in the playoffs to set a team record. ... The Penguins are 10-7 in Game 7s. ... It was the fifth one-goal game of the series.  ",Ary M,Senators season ends in Game 7,"This run will go down as the third-best season in franchise history. Weêll always be wondering Çwhat ifê, just like we did many times in the mid-00s, but letês not forget that thereês a lot to be proud of. The first period was strikingly similar to Game 1, and ended 0-0 with only 11 shots on net (6-5, Ottawa). Game plan: executed.  When the Penguins got the first goal in period two   Kunitzês first since February   it was tense. We had all heard the stat that 75% of teams who score the first goal win Game 7. But as always, the Senators did everything they good to buck the trend, as Erik Karlsson and Mark Stone flew down the ice and Stone potted a perfect wrist shot behind Matt Murray just 20 seconds later. The Penguins would strike again, on their first and only powerplay of the night on a Dion Phaneuf interference penalty. Phil Kessel, the benefactor of the call, couldêve dove, but really, I donêt think it matters much. You shouldnêt put yourself in a position to take a call because you know that the refs were looking to give the Penguins something anyways after the Senators had the first two chances with the extra skater; they went 0/2 on the night. Justin Schultz made quick work of Craig Anderson with a wrist shot just under the right post with lots of traffic in front, and the Penguins took a 2-1 lead in the third period.  As heês done all season, Erik Karlsson put the Senators on his back once again, playing nearly much of the next 3 minutes of game time until Ryan Dzingel scored the biggest goal of his career. I thought Karlsson would get it, as Murray was screened and The Captain usually doesnêt miss from his patented right point location if he has time and space to load up a slap shot. He beat Murray, but was stopped by the post. Thankfully, Dzingel was right there to hammer the puck into the empty net to set up overtime. The whistles completely went away in overtime, and there were multiple instances of obvious penalties on both sides. Should Jean-Gabriel Pageau have gotten a penalty shot? If this was the regular season, Iêd bet good money on it. But alas, it isnêt, and the officiating standard in the NHL has been ineffective and ridiculous for quite some time. Instead, Iêll look at the Sens only being able to manage 2 shots on goal and 10 shot attempts in the first overtime period as evidence that they seemed to be playing to not lose than trying to win. There was offensive zone pressure   absolutely   but the instances were too few and far between.  Then, we all saw what happened a few minutes into second overtime, and I donêt think thereês any need for us to relive that.  Instead, Iêll use this closing space to say thank you. Thank you to Bryan Murray, Nicholle Anderson, Jonathan Pitre, Clarke MacArthur, and the many other folks in the Senators community for all they went through this year. Thanks to Pierre Dorion, for doing His Best to improve the teamês depth in order to give the team a fighting chance to do Anything these playoffs. Thanks to Guy Boucher, who managed to give this team structure that we hadnêt seen for the last decade. Thanks to the fans (and you!) for supporting this team and this community regardless of what happened   if we donêt stick together, no one will fight for us. Thanks to the players, for leaving it all on the ice and the magic you created with this inconceivable run. And thanks to Erik Karlsson, for being the engine behind it all.  ",Pensburgh,Penguins win in Game 7 double OT to earn Stanley Cup Final berth!,"No sense in a lot of analysis, for the 6th time in franchise history, and the 4th time in the last 10 years, the Pittsburgh Penguins are back in the Stanley Cup Final! Chris Kunitz (goal-less in his last 22 playoff games entering tonight) scores twice including the only goal that really mattered in double overtime to push the Pens back to dance with Lord Stanley. Genius move by Mike Sullivan to shift Kunitz and previously healthy scratched Conor Shearyup to the Sidney Crosby line and that move paid the ultimate dividend tonight. Seemingly everything Sullivan touches turns to gold as he's now 7-0 in playoff series as the bench boss with the Pens. But a big stick tap to Craig Anderson and the Senators. Pittsburgh outplayed them for much of this series, but they hung tough. Can't get any closer. One bounce the other way and they're off to maybe the most unlikely of conference wins of recent memory (if not all time). And they deserved to be right there. But, only one can move on and that one is the Pittsburgh Penguins. Game 1 is in the'Burgh on Monday night against the Western Conference champion Nashville Predators.  "
